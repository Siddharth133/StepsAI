The examples that the system uses to learn are\ncalled the training set. Each training example is called a training instance (or sample).\nIn this case, the task T is to flag spam for new emails, the experience E is the training\ndata, and the performance measure P needs to be defined; for example, you can use\nthe ratio of correctly classified emails. This particular performance measure is called\naccuracy and it is often used in classification tasks.\nIf you just download a copy of Wikipedia, your computer has a lot more data, but it is\nnot suddenly better at any task. Thus, it is not Machine Learning.",

                        "content": "\nWhy Use Machine Learning?\nConsider how you would write a spam filter using traditional programming techni\u2010\nques (Figure 1-1):\n|\nChapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape\n1. First you would look at what spam typically looks like. You might notice that\nsome words or phrases (such as \u201c4U,\u201d \u201ccredit card,\u201d \u201cfree,\u201d and \u201camazing\u201d) tend to\ncome up a lot in the subject. Perhaps you would also notice a few other patterns\nin the sender\u2019s name, the email\u2019s body, and so on.\n2. You would write a detection algorithm for each of the patterns that you noticed,\nand your program would flag emails as spam if a number of these patterns are\ndetected.\n3. You would test your program, and repeat steps 1 and 2 until it is good enough.\nFigure 1-1. The traditional approach\nSince the problem is not trivial, your program will likely become a long list of com\u2010\nplex rules\u2014pretty hard to maintain.\nIn contrast, a spam filter based on Machine Learning techniques automatically learns\nwhich words and phrases are good predictors of spam by detecting unusually fre\u2010\nquent patterns of words in the spam examples compared to the ham examples\n(Figure 1-2). The program is much shorter, easier to maintain, and most likely more\naccurate.\nWhy Use Machine Learning?\n|\nFigure 1-2. Machine Learning approach\nMoreover, if spammers notice that all their emails containing \u201c4U\u201d are blocked, they\nmight start writing \u201cFor U\u201d instead. A spam filter using traditional programming\ntechniques would need to be updated to flag \u201cFor U\u201d emails. If spammers keep work\u2010\ning around your spam filter, you will need to keep writing new rules forever.\nIn contrast, a spam filter based on Machine Learning techniques automatically noti\u2010\nces that \u201cFor U\u201d has become unusually frequent in spam flagged by users, and it starts\nflagging them without your intervention (Figure 1-3).\nFigure 1-3. Automatically adapting to change\nAnother area where Machine Learning shines is for problems that either are too com\u2010\nplex for traditional approaches or have no known algorithm. For example, consider\nspeech recognition: say you want to start simple and write a program capable of dis\u2010\ntinguishing the words \u201cone\u201d and \u201ctwo.\u201d You might notice that the word \u201ctwo\u201d starts\nwith a high-pitch sound (\u201cT\u201d), so you could hardcode an algorithm that measures\nhigh-pitch sound intensity and use that to distinguish ones and twos. Obviously this\ntechnique will not scale to thousands of words spoken by millions of very different\n|\nChapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape\npeople in noisy environments and in dozens of languages. The best solution (at least\ntoday) is to write an algorithm that learns by itself, given many example recordings\nfor each word.\nFinally, Machine Learning can help humans learn (Figure 1-4): ML algorithms can be\ninspected to see what they have learned (although for some algorithms this can be\ntricky). For instance, once the spam filter has been trained on enough spam, it can\neasily be inspected to reveal the list of words and combinations of words that it\nbelieves are the best predictors of spam. Sometimes this will reveal unsuspected cor\u2010\nrelations or new trends, and thereby lead to a better understanding of the problem.\nApplying ML techniques to dig into large amounts of data can help discover patterns\nthat were not immediately apparent. This is called data mining.\nFigure 1-4. Machine Learning can help humans learn\nTo summarize, Machine Learning is great for:\n\u2022 Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of hand-tuning or long lists of\nrules: one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform bet\u2010\nter.\n\u2022 Complex problems for which there is no good solution at all using a traditional\napproach: the best Machine Learning techniques can find a solution.\n\u2022 Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data.\n\u2022 Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.\nWhy Use Machine Learning?\n|",

                    "content": "\nTypes of Machine Learning Systems\nThere are so many different types of Machine Learning systems that it is useful to\nclassify them in broad categories based on:\n\u2022 Whether or not they are trained with human supervision (supervised, unsuper\u2010\nvised, semisupervised, and Reinforcement Learning)\n\u2022 Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly (online versus batch\nlearning)\n\u2022 Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points,\nor instead detect patterns in the training data and build a predictive model, much\nlike scientists do (instance-based versus model-based learning)\nThese criteria are not exclusive; you can combine them in any way you like. For\nexample, a state-of-the-art spam filter may learn on the fly using a deep neural net\u2010\nwork model trained using examples of spam and ham; this makes it an online, model-\nbased, supervised learning system.\nLet\u2019s look at each of these criteria a bit more closely.\nTypes of Machine Learning Systems\n|\n2 Some neural network architectures can be unsupervised, such as autoencoders and restricted Boltzmann\nmachines. They can also be semisupervised, such as in deep belief networks and unsupervised pretraining.\nHere are some of the most important supervised learning algorithms (covered in this\nbook):\n\u2022 k-Nearest Neighbors\n\u2022 Linear Regression\n\u2022 Logistic Regression\n\u2022 Support Vector Machines (SVMs)\n\u2022 Decision Trees and Random Forests\n\u2022 Neural networks2\nUnsupervised learning\nIn unsupervised learning, as you might guess, the training data is unlabeled\n(Figure 1-7). The system tries to learn without a teacher.\nFigure 1-7. An unlabeled training set for unsupervised learning\nHere are some of the most important unsupervised learning algorithms (most of\nthese are covered in Chapter 8 and Chapter 9):\n\u2022 Clustering\n\u2014 K-Means\n\u2014 DBSCAN\n\u2014 Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)\n\u2022 Anomaly detection and novelty detection\n\u2014 One-class SVM\n\u2014 Isolation Forest\n|\nChapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape\n\u2022 Visualization and dimensionality reduction\n\u2014 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n\u2014 Kernel PCA\n\u2014 Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)\n\u2014 t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)\n\u2022 Association rule learning\n\u2014 Apriori\n\u2014 Eclat\nFor example, say you have a lot of data about your blog\u2019s visitors. You may want to\nrun a clustering algorithm to try to detect groups of similar visitors (Figure 1-8). At\nno point do you tell the algorithm which group a visitor belongs to: it finds those\nconnections without your help. For example, it might notice that 40% of your visitors\nare males who love comic books and generally read your blog in the evening, while\n20% are young sci-fi lovers who visit during the weekends, and so on. If you use a\nhierarchical clustering algorithm, it may also subdivide each group into smaller\ngroups. This may help you target your posts for each group.\nFigure 1-8. Clustering\nVisualization algorithms are also good examples of unsupervised learning algorithms:\nyou feed them a lot of complex and unlabeled data, and they output a 2D or 3D rep\u2010\nresentation of your data that can easily be plotted (Figure 1-9). These algorithms try\nto preserve as much structure as they can (e.g., trying to keep separate clusters in the\ninput space from overlapping in the visualization), so you can understand how the\ndata is organized and perhaps identify unsuspected patterns.\nTypes of Machine Learning Systems\n|\n3 Notice how animals are rather well separated from vehicles, how horses are close to deer but far from birds,\nand so on. Figure reproduced with permission from Socher, Ganjoo, Manning, and Ng (2013), \u201cT-SNE visual\u2010\nization of the semantic word space.\u201d\nFigure 1-9. Example of a t-SNE visualization highlighting semantic clusters3\nA related task is dimensionality reduction, in which the goal is to simplify the data\nwithout losing too much information. One way to do this is to merge several correla\u2010\nted features into one. For example, a car\u2019s mileage may be very correlated with its age,\nso the dimensionality reduction algorithm will merge them into one feature that rep\u2010\nresents the car\u2019s wear and tear. This is called feature extraction.\nIt is often a good idea to try to reduce the dimension of your train\u2010\ning data using a dimensionality reduction algorithm before you\nfeed it to another Machine Learning algorithm (such as a super\u2010\nvised learning algorithm). It will run much faster, the data will take\nup less disk and memory space, and in some cases it may also per\u2010\nform better.\nYet another important unsupervised task is anomaly detection\u2014for example, detect\u2010\ning unusual credit card transactions to prevent fraud, catching manufacturing defects,\nor automatically removing outliers from a dataset before feeding it to another learn\u2010\ning algorithm. The system is shown mostly normal instances during training, so it\nlearns to recognize them and when it sees a new instance it can tell whether it looks\n|\nChapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape\n4 That\u2019s when the system works perfectly. In practice it often creates a few clusters per person, and sometimes\nmixes up two people who look alike, so you need to provide a few labels per person and manually clean up\nsome clusters.\nlike a normal one or whether it is likely an anomaly (see Figure 1-10). A very similar\ntask is novelty detection: the difference is that novelty detection algorithms expect to\nsee only normal data during training, while anomaly detection algorithms are usually\nmore tolerant, they can often perform well even with a small percentage of outliers in\nthe training set.\nFigure 1-10. Anomaly detection\nFinally, another common unsupervised task is association rule learning, in which the\ngoal is to dig into large amounts of data and discover interesting relations between\nattributes. For example, suppose you own a supermarket. Running an association rule\non your sales logs may reveal that people who purchase barbecue sauce and potato\nchips also tend to buy steak. Thus, you may want to place these items close to each\nother.\nSemisupervised learning\nSome algorithms can deal with partially labeled training data, usually a lot of unla\u2010\nbeled data and a little bit of labeled data. This is called semisupervised learning\n(Figure 1-11).\nSome photo-hosting services, such as Google Photos, are good examples of this. Once\nyou upload all your family photos to the service, it automatically recognizes that the\nsame person A shows up in photos 1, 5, and 11, while another person B shows up in\nphotos 2, 5, and 7. This is the unsupervised part of the algorithm (clustering). Now all\nthe system needs is for you to tell it who these people are. Just one label per person,4\nand it is able to name everyone in every photo, which is useful for searching photos.\nTypes of Machine Learning Systems\n|\nFigure 1-11. Semisupervised learning\nMost semisupervised learning algorithms are combinations of unsupervised and\nsupervised algorithms. For example, deep belief networks (DBNs) are based on unsu\u2010\npervised components called restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) stacked on top of\none another. RBMs are trained sequentially in an unsupervised manner, and then the\nwhole system is fine-tuned using supervised learning techniques.\nReinforcement Learning\nReinforcement Learning is a very different beast. The learning system, called an agent\nin this context, can observe the environment, select and perform actions, and get\nrewards in return (or penalties in the form of negative rewards, as in Figure 1-12). It\nmust then learn by itself what is the best strategy, called a policy, to get the most\nreward over time. A policy defines what action the agent should choose when it is in a\ngiven situation.\n|\nChapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape\nFigure 1-12. Reinforcement Learning\nFor example, many robots implement Reinforcement Learning algorithms to learn\nhow to walk. DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo program is also a good example of Reinforcement\nLearning: it made the headlines in May 2017 when it beat the world champion Ke Jie\nat the game of Go. It learned its winning policy by analyzing millions of games, and\nthen playing many games against itself. Note that learning was turned off during the\ngames against the champion; AlphaGo was just applying the policy it had learned.\nTypes of Machine Learning Systems\n|\nbatch learning system can adapt to change. Simply update the data and train a new\nversion of the system from scratch as often as needed.\nThis solution is simple and often works fine, but training using the full set of data can\ntake many hours, so you would typically train a new system only every 24 hours or\neven just weekly. If your system needs to adapt to rapidly changing data (e.g., to pre\u2010\ndict stock prices), then you need a more reactive solution.\nAlso, training on the full set of data requires a lot of computing resources (CPU,\nmemory space, disk space, disk I/O, network I/O, etc.). If you have a lot of data and\nyou automate your system to train from scratch every day, it will end up costing you a\nlot of money. If the amount of data is huge, it may even be impossible to use a batch\nlearning algorithm.\nFinally, if your system needs to be able to learn autonomously and it has limited\nresources (e.g., a smartphone application or a rover on Mars), then carrying around\nlarge amounts of training data and taking up a lot of resources to train for hours\nevery day is a showstopper.\nFortunately, a better option in all these cases is to use algorithms that are capable of\nlearning incrementally.\nOnline learning\nIn online learning, you train the system incrementally by feeding it data instances\nsequentially, either individually or by small groups called mini-batches. Each learning\nstep is fast and cheap, so the system can learn about new data on the fly, as it arrives\n(see Figure 1-13).\nFigure 1-13. Online learning\nOnline learning is great for systems that receive data as a continuous flow (e.g., stock\nprices) and need to adapt to change rapidly or autonomously. It is also a good option\n|\nChapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape\nif you have limited computing resources: once an online learning system has learned\nabout new data instances, it does not need them anymore, so you can discard them\n(unless you want to be able to roll back to a previous state and \u201creplay\u201d the data). This\ncan save a huge amount of space.\nOnline learning algorithms can also be used to train systems on huge datasets that\ncannot fit in one machine\u2019s main memory (this is called out-of-core learning). The\nalgorithm loads part of the data, runs a training step on that data, and repeats the\nprocess until it has run on all of the data (see Figure 1-14).\nOut-of-core learning is usually done offline (i.e., not on the live\nsystem), so online learning can be a confusing name. Think of it as\nincremental learning.\nFigure 1-14. Using online learning to handle huge datasets\nOne important parameter of online learning systems is how fast they should adapt to\nchanging data: this is called the learning rate. If you set a high learning rate, then your\nsystem will rapidly adapt to new data, but it will also tend to quickly forget the old\ndata (you don\u2019t want a spam filter to flag only the latest kinds of spam it was shown).\nConversely, if you set a low learning rate, the system will have more inertia; that is, it\nwill learn more slowly, but it will also be less sensitive to noise in the new data or to\nsequences of nonrepresentative data points (outliers).\nA big challenge with online learning is that if bad data is fed to the system, the sys\u2010\ntem\u2019s performance will gradually decline. If we are talking about a live system, your\nclients will notice. For example, bad data could come from a malfunctioning sensor\non a robot, or from someone spamming a search engine to try to rank high in search\nTypes of Machine Learning Systems\n|\nresults. To reduce this risk, you need to monitor your system closely and promptly\nswitch learning off (and possibly revert to a previously working state) if you detect a\ndrop in performance. You may also want to monitor the input data and react to\nabnormal data (e.g., using an anomaly detection algorithm).\nTypes of Machine Learning Systems\n|\n5 By convention, the Greek letter \u03b8 (theta) is frequently used to represent model parameters.\nTable 1-1. Does money make people happier?\nCountry\nGDP per capita (USD)\nLife satisfaction\nHungary\n12,240\n4.9\nKorea\n27,195\n5.8\nFrance\n37,675\n6.5\nAustralia\n50,962\n7.3\nUnited States\n55,805\n7.2\nLet\u2019s plot the data for a few random countries (Figure 1-17).\nFigure 1-17. Do you see a trend here?\nThere does seem to be a trend here! Although the data is noisy (i.e., partly random), it\nlooks like life satisfaction goes up more or less linearly as the country\u2019s GDP per cap\u2010\nita increases. So you decide to model life satisfaction as a linear function of GDP per\ncapita. This step is called model selection: you selected a linear model of life satisfac\u2010\ntion with just one attribute, GDP per capita (Equation 1-1).\nEquation 1-1. A simple linear model\nlife_satisfaction = \u03b80 + \u03b81 \u00d7 GDP_per_capita\nThis model has two model parameters, \u03b80 and \u03b81.5 By tweaking these parameters, you\ncan make your model represent any linear function, as shown in Figure 1-18.\n|\nChapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape\nFigure 1-18. A few possible linear models\nBefore you can use your model, you need to define the parameter values \u03b80 and \u03b81.\nHow can you know which values will make your model perform best? To answer this\nquestion, you need to specify a performance measure. You can either define a utility\nfunction (or fitness function) that measures how good your model is, or you can define\na cost function that measures how bad it is. For linear regression problems, people\ntypically use a cost function that measures the distance between the linear model\u2019s\npredictions and the training examples; the objective is to minimize this distance.\nThis is where the Linear Regression algorithm comes in: you feed it your training\nexamples and it finds the parameters that make the linear model fit best to your data.\nThis is called training the model. In our case the algorithm finds that the optimal\nparameter values are \u03b80 = 4.85 and \u03b81 = 4.91 \u00d7 10\u20135.\nNow the model fits the training data as closely as possible (for a linear model), as you\ncan see in Figure 1-19.\nFigure 1-19. The linear model that fits the training data best\nTypes of Machine Learning Systems\n|\n6 The prepare_country_stats() function\u2019s definition is not shown here (see this chapter\u2019s Jupyter notebook if\nyou want all the gory details). It\u2019s just boring Pandas code that joins the life satisfaction data from the OECD\nwith the GDP per capita data from the IMF.\n7 It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t understand all the code yet; we will present Scikit-Learn in the following chapters.\nYou are finally ready to run the model to make predictions. For example, say you\nwant to know how happy Cypriots are, and the OECD data does not have the answer.\nFortunately, you can use your model to make a good prediction: you look up Cyprus\u2019s\nGDP per capita, find $22,587, and then apply your model and find that life satisfac\u2010\ntion is likely to be somewhere around 4.85 + 22,587 \u00d7 4.91 \u00d7 10-5 = 5.96.\nTo whet your appetite, Example 1-1 shows the Python code that loads the data, pre\u2010\npares it,6 creates a scatterplot for visualization, and then trains a linear model and\nmakes a prediction.7\nExample 1-1. Training and running a linear model using Scikit-Learn\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport sklearn.linear_model\n# Load the data\noecd_bli = pd.read_csv(\"oecd_bli_2015.csv\", thousands=',')\ngdp_per_capita = pd.read_csv(\"gdp_per_capita.csv\",thousands=',',delimiter='\\t',\nencoding='latin1', na_values=\"n/a\")\n# Prepare the data\ncountry_stats = prepare_country_stats(oecd_bli, gdp_per_capita)\nX = np.c_[country_stats[\"GDP per capita\"]]\ny = np.c_[country_stats[\"Life satisfaction\"]]\n# Visualize the data\ncountry_stats.plot(kind='scatter', x=\"GDP per capita\", y='Life satisfaction')\nplt.show()\n# Select a linear model\nmodel = sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(X, y)\n# Make a prediction for Cyprus\nX_new = [[22587]]  # Cyprus' GDP per capita\nprint(model.predict(X_new)) # outputs [[ 5.96242338]]\n|\nChapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape\nIf you had used an instance-based learning algorithm instead, you\nwould have found that Slovenia has the closest GDP per capita to\nthat of Cyprus ($20,732), and since the OECD data tells us that\nSlovenians\u2019 life satisfaction is 5.7, you would have predicted a life\nsatisfaction of 5.7 for Cyprus. If you zoom out a bit and look at the\ntwo next closest countries, you will find Portugal and Spain with\nlife satisfactions of 5.1 and 6.5, respectively. Averaging these three\nvalues, you get 5.77, which is pretty close to your model-based pre\u2010\ndiction. This simple algorithm is called k-Nearest Neighbors regres\u2010\nsion (in this example, k = 3).\nReplacing the Linear Regression model with k-Nearest Neighbors\nregression in the previous code is as simple as replacing these two\nlines:\nimport sklearn.linear_model\nmodel = sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()\nwith these two:\nimport sklearn.neighbors\nmodel = sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=3)\nIf all went well, your model will make good predictions. If not, you may need to use\nmore attributes (employment rate, health, air pollution, etc.), get more or better qual\u2010\nity training data, or perhaps select a more powerful model (e.g., a Polynomial Regres\u2010\nsion model).\nIn summary:\n\u2022 You studied the data.\n\u2022 You selected a model.\n\u2022 You trained it on the training data (i.e., the learning algorithm searched for the\nmodel parameter values that minimize a cost function).\n\u2022 Finally, you applied the model to make predictions on new cases (this is called\ninference), hoping that this model will generalize well.\nThis is what a typical Machine Learning project looks like. In Chapter 2 you will\nexperience this first-hand by going through an end-to-end project.\nWe have covered a lot of ground so far: you now know what Machine Learning is\nreally about, why it is useful, what some of the most common categories of ML sys\u2010\ntems are, and what a typical project workflow looks like. Now let\u2019s look at what can go\nwrong in learning and prevent you from making accurate predictions.\nTypes of Machine Learning Systems\n|",

There are four major categories: supervised\nlearning, unsupervised learning, semisupervised learning, and Reinforcement Learn\u2010\ning.\nSupervised learning\nIn supervised learning, the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired\nsolutions, called labels (Figure 1-5).\nFigure 1-5.

This name was then applied to the methods he used to analyze correlations\nbetween variables.\nA typical supervised learning task is classification. The spam filter is a good example\nof this: it is trained with many example emails along with their class (spam or ham),\nand it must learn how to classify new emails.\nAnother typical task is to predict a target numeric value, such as the price of a car,\ngiven a set of features (mileage, age, brand, etc.) called predictors. This sort of task is\ncalled regression (Figure 1-6).1 To train the system, you need to give it many examples\nof cars, including both their predictors and their labels (i.e., their prices).\nIn Machine Learning an attribute is a data type (e.g., \u201cMileage\u201d),\nwhile a feature has several meanings depending on the context, but\ngenerally means an attribute plus its value (e.g., \u201cMileage =\n15,000\u201d).

Having a good performance measure on the training data is\ngood, but insufficient; the true goal is to perform well on new instances.\nThere are two main approaches to generalization: instance-based learning and\nmodel-based learning.\nInstance-based learning\nPossibly the most trivial form of learning is simply to learn by heart. If you were to\ncreate a spam filter this way, it would just flag all emails that are identical to emails\nthat have already been flagged by users\u2014not the worst solution, but certainly not the\nbest.\nInstead of just flagging emails that are identical to known spam emails, your spam\nfilter could be programmed to also flag emails that are very similar to known spam\nemails. This requires a measure of similarity between two emails. A (very basic) simi\u2010\nlarity measure between two emails could be to count the number of words they have\nin common. The system would flag an email as spam if it has many words in com\u2010\nmon with a known spam email.\nThis is called instance-based learning: the system learns the examples by heart, then\ngeneralizes to new cases by comparing them to the learned examples (or a subset of\nthem), using a similarity measure. For example, in Figure 1-15 the new instance\nwould be classified as a triangle because the majority of the most similar instances\nbelong to that class.\n|\nChapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape\nFigure 1-15.

Figure 1-21 shows what the\ndata looks like when you add the missing countries.\nFigure 1-21. A more representative training sample\nIf you train a linear model on this data, you get the solid line, while the old model is\nrepresented by the dotted line. As you can see, not only does adding a few missing\ncountries significantly alter the model, but it makes it clear that such a simple linear\nmodel is probably never going to work well. It seems that very rich countries are not\nhappier than moderately rich countries (in fact they seem unhappier), and conversely\nsome poor countries seem happier than many rich countries.\nBy using a nonrepresentative training set, we trained a model that is unlikely to make\naccurate predictions, especially for very poor and very rich countries.\nIt is crucial to use a training set that is representative of the cases you want to general\u2010\nize to. This is often harder than it sounds: if the sample is too small, you will have\nsampling noise (i.e., nonrepresentative data as a result of chance), but even very large\nsamples can be nonrepresentative if the sampling method is flawed. This is called\nsampling bias.\nA Famous Example of Sampling Bias\nPerhaps the most famous example of sampling bias happened during the US presi\u2010\ndential election in 1936, which pitted Landon against Roosevelt: the Literary Digest\nconducted a very large poll, sending mail to about 10 million people. It got 2.4 million\nanswers, and predicted with high confidence that Landon would get 57% of the votes.\n|\nChapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape\nInstead, Roosevelt won with 62% of the votes. The flaw was in the Literary Digest\u2019s\nsampling method:\n\u2022 First, to obtain the addresses to send the polls to, the Literary Digest used tele\u2010\nphone directories, lists of magazine subscribers, club membership lists, and the\nlike. All of these lists tend to favor wealthier people, who are more likely to vote\nRepublican (hence Landon).\n\u2022 Second, less than 25% of the people who received the poll answered. Again, this\nintroduces a sampling bias, by ruling out people who don\u2019t care much about poli\u2010\ntics, people who don\u2019t like the Literary Digest, and other key groups. This is a spe\u2010\ncial type of sampling bias called nonresponse bias.\nHere is another example: say you want to build a system to recognize funk music vid\u2010\neos. One way to build your training set is to search \u201cfunk music\u201d on YouTube and use\nthe resulting videos. But this assumes that YouTube\u2019s search engine returns a set of\nvideos that are representative of all the funk music videos on YouTube. In reality, the\nsearch results are likely to be biased toward popular artists (and if you live in Brazil\nyou will get a lot of \u201cfunk carioca\u201d videos, which sound nothing like James Brown).\nOn the other hand, how else can you get a large training set?",

You might be\ntempted to say that all taxi drivers in that country are thieves. Overgeneralizing is\nsomething that we humans do all too often, and unfortunately machines can fall into\nthe same trap if we are not careful. In Machine Learning this is called overfitting: it\nmeans that the model performs well on the training data, but it does not generalize\nwell.\nFigure 1-22 shows an example of a high-degree polynomial life satisfaction model\nthat strongly overfits the training data. Even though it performs much better on the\ntraining data than the simple linear model, would you really trust its predictions?\nFigure 1-22. Overfitting the training data\nComplex models such as deep neural networks can detect subtle patterns in the data,\nbut if the training set is noisy, or if it is too small (which introduces sampling noise),\nthen the model is likely to detect patterns in the noise itself. Obviously these patterns\nwill not generalize to new instances. For example, say you feed your life satisfaction\nmodel many more attributes, including uninformative ones such as the country\u2019s\nname. In that case, a complex model may detect patterns like the fact that all coun\u2010\ntries in the training data with a w in their name have a life satisfaction greater than 7:\nNew Zealand (7.3), Norway (7.4), Sweden (7.2), and Switzerland (7.5). How confident\n|\nChapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape\nare you that the W-satisfaction rule generalizes to Rwanda or Zimbabwe? Obviously\nthis pattern occurred in the training data by pure chance, but the model has no way\nto tell whether a pattern is real or simply the result of noise in the data.\nOverfitting happens when the model is too complex relative to the\namount and noisiness of the training data. The possible solutions\nare:\n\u2022 To simplify the model by selecting one with fewer parameters\n(e.g., a linear model rather than a high-degree polynomial\nmodel), by reducing the number of attributes in the training\ndata or by constraining the model\n\u2022 To gather more training data\n\u2022 To reduce the noise in the training data (e.g., fix data errors\nand remove outliers)\nConstraining a model to make it simpler and reduce the risk of overfitting is called\nregularization. For example, the linear model we defined earlier has two parameters,\n\u03b80 and \u03b81. This gives the learning algorithm two degrees of freedom to adapt the model\nto the training data: it can tweak both the height (\u03b80) and the slope (\u03b81) of the line. If\nwe forced \u03b81 = 0, the algorithm would have only one degree of freedom and would\nhave a much harder time fitting the data properly: all it could do is move the line up\nor down to get as close as possible to the training instances, so it would end up\naround the mean. A very simple model indeed! If we allow the algorithm to modify \u03b81\nbut we force it to keep it small, then the learning algorithm will effectively have some\u2010\nwhere in between one and two degrees of freedom. It will produce a simpler model\nthan with two degrees of freedom, but more complex than with just one. You want to\nfind the right balance between fitting the training data perfectly and keeping the\nmodel simple enough to ensure that it will generalize well.\nFigure 1-23 shows three models: the dotted line represents the original model that\nwas trained with a few countries missing, the dashed line is our second model trained\nwith all countries, and the solid line is a linear model trained with the same data as\nthe first model but with a regularization constraint. You can see that regularization\nforced the model to have a smaller slope, which fits a bit less the training data that the\nmodel was trained on, but actually allows it to generalize better to new examples.",

The question is: how do you choose the value of\nthe regularization hyperparameter? One option is to train 100 different models using\n100 different values for this hyperparameter. Suppose you find the best hyperparame\u2010\nter value that produces a model with the lowest generalization error, say just 5% error.\nSo you launch this model into production, but unfortunately it does not perform as\nwell as expected and produces 15% errors. What just happened?\nThe problem is that you measured the generalization error multiple times on the test\nset, and you adapted the model and hyperparameters to produce the best model for\nthat particular set. This means that the model is unlikely to perform as well on new\ndata.\nA common solution to this problem is called holdout validation: you simply hold out\npart of the training set to evaluate several candidate models and select the best one.\nThe new heldout set is called the validation set (or sometimes the development set, or\ndev set). More specifically, you train multiple models with various hyperparameters\non the reduced training set (i.e., the full training set minus the validation set), and\nyou select the model that performs best on the validation set. After this holdout vali\u2010\ndation process, you train the best model on the full training set (including the valida\u2010\ntion set), and this gives you the final model. Lastly, you evaluate this final model on\nthe test set to get an estimate of the generalization error.\nThis solution usually works quite well. However, if the validation set is too small, then\nmodel evaluations will be imprecise: you may end up selecting a suboptimal model by\nmistake. Conversely, if the validation set is too large, then the remaining training set\nwill be much smaller than the full training set. Why is this bad? Well, since the final\nmodel will be trained on the full training set, it is not ideal to compare candidate\nmodels trained on a much smaller training set. It would be like selecting the fastest\nsprinter to participate in a marathon. One way to solve this problem is to perform\nrepeated cross-validation, using many small validation sets. Each model is evaluated\nonce per validation set, after it is trained on the rest of the data. By averaging out all\nthe evaluations of a model, we get a much more accurate measure of its performance.\nHowever, there is a drawback: the training time is multiplied by the number of valida\u2010\ntion sets.\n|\nChapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape\n11 \u201cThe Lack of A Priori Distinctions Between Learning Algorithms,\u201d D.

You can easily download millions of pictures of flowers on the\nweb, but they won\u2019t be perfectly representative of the pictures that will actually be\ntaken using the app on a mobile device. Perhaps you only have 10,000 representative\npictures (i.e., actually taken with the app). In this case, the most important rule to\nremember is that the validation set and the test must be as representative as possible\nof the data you expect to use in production, so they should be composed exclusively\nof representative pictures: you can shuffle them and put half in the validation set, and\nhalf in the test set (making sure that no duplicates or near-duplicates end up in both\nsets). After training your model on the web pictures, if you observe that the perfor\u2010\nmance of your model on the validation set is disappointing, you will not know\nwhether this is because your model has overfit the training set, or whether this is just\ndue to the mismatch between the web pictures and the mobile app pictures. One sol\u2010\nution is to hold out part of the training pictures (from the web) in yet another set that\nAndrew Ng calls the train-dev set. After the model is trained (on the training set, not\non the train-dev set), you can evaluate it on the train-dev set: if it performs well, then\nthe model is not overfitting the training set, so if performs poorly on the validation\nset, the problem must come from the data mismatch. You can try to tackle this prob\u2010\nlem by preprocessing the web images to make them look more like the pictures that\nwill be taken by the mobile app, and then retraining the model. Conversely, if the\nmodel performs poorly on the train-dev set, then the model must have overfit the\ntraining set, so you should try to simplify or regularize the model, get more training\ndata and clean up the training data, as discussed earlier.\nNo Free Lunch Theorem\nA model is a simplified version of the observations. The simplifications are meant to\ndiscard the superfluous details that are unlikely to generalize to new instances. How\u2010\never, to decide what data to discard and what data to keep, you must make assump\u2010\ntions. For example, a linear model makes the assumption that the data is\nfundamentally linear and that the distance between the instances and the straight line\nis just noise, which can safely be ignored.\nIn a famous 1996 paper,11 David Wolpert demonstrated that if you make absolutely\nno assumption about the data, then there is no reason to prefer one model over any\nother. This is called the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem. For some datasets the best",

When a feature has a bell-shaped normal\ndistribution (also called a Gaussian distribution), which is very common, the \u201c68-95-99.7\u201d rule applies: about\n68% of the values fall within 1\u03c3 of the mean, 95% within 2\u03c3, and 99.7% within 3\u03c3.\nFigure 2-7. Summary of each numerical attribute\nThe count, mean, min, and max rows are self-explanatory. Note that the null values are\nignored (so, for example, count of total_bedrooms is 20,433, not 20,640). The std\nrow shows the standard deviation, which measures how dispersed the values are.12\nThe 25%, 50%, and 75% rows show the corresponding percentiles: a percentile indi\u2010\ncates the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observa\u2010\ntions falls. For example, 25% of the districts have a housing_median_age lower than\n18, while 50% are lower than 29 and 75% are lower than 37. These are often called the\n25th percentile (or 1st quartile), the median, and the 75th percentile (or 3rd quartile).\nAnother quick way to get a feel of the type of data you are dealing with is to plot a\nhistogram for each numerical attribute. A histogram shows the number of instances\n(on the vertical axis) that have a given value range (on the horizontal axis). You can\neither plot this one attribute at a time, or you can call the hist() method on the\nwhole dataset, and it will plot a histogram for each numerical attribute (see\nFigure 2-8). For example, you can see that slightly over 800 districts have a\nmedian_house_value equal to about $100,000.\n%matplotlib inline   # only in a Jupyter notebook\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nhousing.hist(bins=50, figsize=(20,15))\nplt.show()\n|\nChapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project\nThe hist() method relies on Matplotlib, which in turn relies on a\nuser-specified graphical backend to draw on your screen. So before\nyou can plot anything, you need to specify which backend Matplot\u2010\nlib should use. The simplest option is to use Jupyter\u2019s magic com\u2010\nmand %matplotlib inline. This tells Jupyter to set up Matplotlib\nso it uses Jupyter\u2019s own backend. Plots are then rendered within the\nnotebook itself. Note that calling show() is optional in a Jupyter\nnotebook, as Jupyter will automatically display plots when a cell is\nexecuted.\nFigure 2-8. A histogram for each numerical attribute\nNotice a few things in these histograms:\n1. First, the median income attribute does not look like it is expressed in US dollars\n(USD). After checking with the team that collected the data, you are told that the\ndata has been scaled and capped at 15 (actually 15.0001) for higher median\nincomes, and at 0.5 (actually 0.4999) for lower median incomes. The numbers\nrepresent roughly tens of thousands of dollars (e.g., 3 actually means about\n$30,000). Working with preprocessed attributes is common in Machine Learning,\nGet the Data\n|\nand it is not necessarily a problem, but you should try to understand how the\ndata was computed.\n2. The housing median age and the median house value were also capped. The lat\u2010\nter may be a serious problem since it is your target attribute (your labels). Your\nMachine Learning algorithms may learn that prices never go beyond that limit.\nYou need to check with your client team (the team that will use your system\u2019s out\u2010\nput) to see if this is a problem or not. If they tell you that they need precise pre\u2010\ndictions even beyond $500,000, then you have mainly two options:\na. Collect proper labels for the districts whose labels were capped.\nb. Remove those districts from the training set (and also from the test set, since\nyour system should not be evaluated poorly if it predicts values beyond\n$500,000).\n3. These attributes have very different scales. We will discuss this later in this chap\u2010\nter when we explore feature scaling.\n4. Finally, many histograms are tail heavy: they extend much farther to the right of\nthe median than to the left. This may make it a bit harder for some Machine\nLearning algorithms to detect patterns. We will try transforming these attributes\nlater on to have more bell-shaped distributions.\nHopefully you now have a better understanding of the kind of data you are dealing\nwith.\nWait! Before you look at the data any further, you need to create a\ntest set, put it aside, and never look at it.\nGet the Data\n|\n15 The location information is actually quite coarse, and as a result many districts will have the exact same ID, so\nthey will end up in the same set (test or train). This introduces some unfortunate sampling bias.\nin_test_set = ids.apply(lambda id_: test_set_check(id_, test_ratio))\nreturn data.loc[~in_test_set], data.loc[in_test_set]\nUnfortunately, the housing dataset does not have an identifier column. The simplest\nsolution is to use the row index as the ID:\nhousing_with_id = housing.reset_index()   # adds an `index` column\ntrain_set, test_set = split_train_test_by_id(housing_with_id, 0.2, \"index\")\nIf you use the row index as a unique identifier, you need to make sure that new data\ngets appended to the end of the dataset, and no row ever gets deleted. If this is not\npossible, then you can try to use the most stable features to build a unique identifier.\nFor example, a district\u2019s latitude and longitude are guaranteed to be stable for a few\nmillion years, so you could combine them into an ID like so:15\nhousing_with_id[\"id\"] = housing[\"longitude\"] * 1000 + housing[\"latitude\"]\ntrain_set, test_set = split_train_test_by_id(housing_with_id, 0.2, \"id\")\nScikit-Learn provides a few functions to split datasets into multiple subsets in various\nways. The simplest function is train_test_split, which does pretty much the same\nthing as the function split_train_test defined earlier, with a couple of additional\nfeatures. First there is a random_state parameter that allows you to set the random\ngenerator seed as explained previously, and second you can pass it multiple datasets\nwith an identical number of rows, and it will split them on the same indices (this is\nvery useful, for example, if you have a separate DataFrame for labels):\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\ntrain_set, test_set = train_test_split(housing, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\nSo far we have considered purely random sampling methods. This is generally fine if\nyour dataset is large enough (especially relative to the number of attributes), but if it\nis not, you run the risk of introducing a significant sampling bias. When a survey\ncompany decides to call 1,000 people to ask them a few questions, they don\u2019t just pick\n1,000 people randomly in a phone book. They try to ensure that these 1,000 people\nare representative of the whole population. For example, the US population is com\u2010\nposed of 51.3% female and 48.7% male, so a well-conducted survey in the US would\ntry to maintain this ratio in the sample: 513 female and 487 male. This is called strati\u2010\nfied sampling: the population is divided into homogeneous subgroups called strata,\nand the right number of instances is sampled from each stratum to guarantee that the\ntest set is representative of the overall population. If they used purely random sam\u2010\npling, there would be about 12% chance of sampling a skewed test set with either less\nthan 49% female or more than 54% female. Either way, the survey results would be\nsignificantly biased.\n|\nChapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project\nSuppose you chatted with experts who told you that the median income is a very\nimportant attribute to predict median housing prices. You may want to ensure that\nthe test set is representative of the various categories of incomes in the whole dataset.\nSince the median income is a continuous numerical attribute, you first need to create\nan income category attribute. Let\u2019s look at the median income histogram more closely\n(back in Figure 2-8): most median income values are clustered around 1.5 to 6 (i.e.,\n$15,000\u2013$60,000), but some median incomes go far beyond 6. It is important to have\na sufficient number of instances in your dataset for each stratum, or else the estimate\nof the stratum\u2019s importance may be biased. This means that you should not have too\nmany strata, and each stratum should be large enough. The following code uses the\npd.cut() function to create an income category attribute with 5 categories (labeled\nfrom 1 to 5): category 1 ranges from 0 to 1.5 (i.e., less than $15,000), category 2 from\n1.5 to 3, and so on:\nhousing[\"income_cat\"] = pd.cut(housing[\"median_income\"],\nbins=[0., 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6., np.inf],\nlabels=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nThese income categories are represented in Figure 2-9:\nhousing[\"income_cat\"].hist()\nFigure 2-9. Histogram of income categories\nNow you are ready to do stratified sampling based on the income category. For this\nyou can use Scikit-Learn\u2019s StratifiedShuffleSplit class:\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedShuffleSplit\nsplit = StratifiedShuffleSplit(n_splits=1, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\nfor train_index, test_index in split.split(housing, housing[\"income_cat\"]):\nstrat_train_set = housing.loc[train_index]\nstrat_test_set = housing.loc[test_index]\nGet the Data\n|\nLet\u2019s see if this worked as expected. You can start by looking at the income category\nproportions in the test set:\n>>> strat_test_set[\"income_cat\"].value_counts() / len(strat_test_set)\n3    0.350533\n2    0.318798\n4    0.176357\n5    0.114583\n1    0.039729\nName: income_cat, dtype: float64\nWith similar code you can measure the income category proportions in the full data\u2010\nset. Figure 2-10 compares the income category proportions in the overall dataset, in\nthe test set generated with stratified sampling, and in a test set generated using purely\nrandom sampling. As you can see, the test set generated using stratified sampling has\nincome category proportions almost identical to those in the full dataset, whereas the\ntest set generated using purely random sampling is quite skewed.\nFigure 2-10. Sampling bias comparison of stratified versus purely random sampling\nNow you should remove the income_cat attribute so the data is back to its original\nstate:\nfor set_ in (strat_train_set, strat_test_set):\nset_.drop(\"income_cat\", axis=1, inplace=True)\nWe spent quite a bit of time on test set generation for a good reason: this is an often\nneglected but critical part of a Machine Learning project. Moreover, many of these\nideas will be useful later when we discuss cross-validation. Now it\u2019s time to move on\nto the next stage: exploring the data.",

After all,\nyou have only taken a quick glance at the data, and surely you should learn a whole\nlot more about it before you decide what algorithms to use, right? This is true, but\nyour brain is an amazing pattern detection system, which means that it is highly\nprone to overfitting: if you look at the test set, you may stumble upon some seemingly\ninteresting pattern in the test data that leads you to select a particular kind of\nMachine Learning model. When you estimate the generalization error using the test\nset, your estimate will be too optimistic and you will launch a system that will not\nperform as well as expected. This is called data snooping bias.\nCreating a test set is theoretically quite simple: just pick some instances randomly,\ntypically 20% of the dataset (or less if your dataset is very large), and set them aside:\n|\nChapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project\n13 In this book, when a code example contains a mix of code and outputs, as is the case here, it is formatted like\nin the Python interpreter, for better readability: the code lines are prefixed with >>> (or ... for indented\nblocks), and the outputs have no prefix.\n14 You will often see people set the random seed to 42. This number has no special property, other than to be\nThe Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.\nimport numpy as np\ndef split_train_test(data, test_ratio):\nshuffled_indices = np.random.permutation(len(data))\ntest_set_size = int(len(data) * test_ratio)\ntest_indices = shuffled_indices[:test_set_size]\ntrain_indices = shuffled_indices[test_set_size:]\nreturn data.iloc[train_indices], data.iloc[test_indices]\nYou can then use this function like this:13\n>>> train_set, test_set = split_train_test(housing, 0.2)\n>>> len(train_set)\n>>> len(test_set)\nWell, this works, but it is not perfect: if you run the program again, it will generate a\ndifferent test set! Over time, you (or your Machine Learning algorithms) will get to\nsee the whole dataset, which is what you want to avoid.\nOne solution is to save the test set on the first run and then load it in subsequent\nruns. Another option is to set the random number generator\u2019s seed (e.g., np.ran\ndom.seed(42))14 before calling np.random.permutation(), so that it always generates\nthe same shuffled indices.\nBut both these solutions will break next time you fetch an updated dataset. A com\u2010\nmon solution is to use each instance\u2019s identifier to decide whether or not it should go\nin the test set (assuming instances have a unique and immutable identifier). For\nexample, you could compute a hash of each instance\u2019s identifier and put that instance\nin the test set if the hash is lower or equal to 20% of the maximum hash value. This\nensures that the test set will remain consistent across multiple runs, even if you\nrefresh the dataset. The new test set will contain 20% of the new instances, but it will\nnot contain any instance that was previously in the training set. Here is a possible\nimplementation:\nfrom zlib import crc32\ndef test_set_check(identifier, test_ratio):\nreturn crc32(np.int64(identifier)) & 0xffffffff < test_ratio * 2**32\ndef split_train_test_by_id(data, test_ratio, id_column):\nids = data[id_column]",

It may completely miss\nout on nonlinear relationships (e.g., \u201cif x is close to zero then y gen\u2010\nerally goes up\u201d). Note how all the plots of the bottom row have a\ncorrelation coefficient equal to zero despite the fact that their axes\nare clearly not independent: these are examples of nonlinear rela\u2010\ntionships.

Buitinck, G. Louppe, M. Blondel, F. Pedregosa, A. M\u00fcller, et al. (2013).\n>>> housing_num.median().values\narray([ -118.51 , 34.26 , 29. , 2119.5 , 433. , 1164. , 408. , 3.5409])\nNow you can use this \u201ctrained\u201d imputer to transform the training set by replacing\nmissing values by the learned medians:\nX = imputer.transform(housing_num)\nThe result is a plain NumPy array containing the transformed features. If you want to\nput it back into a Pandas DataFrame, it\u2019s simple:\nhousing_tr = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=housing_num.columns)\nScikit-Learn Design\nScikit-Learn\u2019s API is remarkably well designed. The main design principles are:17\n\u2022 Consistency. All objects share a consistent and simple interface:\n\u2014 Estimators. Any object that can estimate some parameters based on a dataset\nis called an estimator (e.g., an imputer is an estimator). The estimation itself is\nperformed by the fit() method, and it takes only a dataset as a parameter (or\ntwo for supervised learning algorithms; the second dataset contains the\nlabels). Any other parameter needed to guide the estimation process is con\u2010\nsidered a hyperparameter (such as an imputer\u2019s strategy), and it must be set\nas an instance variable (generally via a constructor parameter).\n\u2014 Transformers. Some estimators (such as an imputer) can also transform a\ndataset; these are called transformers. Once again, the API is quite simple: the\ntransformation is performed by the transform() method with the dataset to\ntransform as a parameter. It returns the transformed dataset. This transforma\u2010\ntion generally relies on the learned parameters, as is the case for an imputer.\nAll transformers also have a convenience method called fit_transform()\nthat is equivalent to calling fit() and then transform() (but sometimes\nfit_transform() is optimized and runs much faster).\n\u2014 Predictors. Finally, some estimators are capable of making predictions given a\ndataset; they are called predictors. For example, the LinearRegression model\nin the previous chapter was a predictor: it predicted life satisfaction given a\ncountry\u2019s GDP per capita. A predictor has a predict() method that takes a\ndataset of new instances and returns a dataset of corresponding predictions. It\nalso has a score() method that measures the quality of the predictions given\n|\nChapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project\n18 Some predictors also provide methods to measure the confidence of their predictions.\n19 This class is available since Scikit-Learn 0.20. If you use an earlier version, please consider upgrading, or use\nPandas\u2019 Series.factorize() method.\na test set (and the corresponding labels in the case of supervised learning\nalgorithms).18\n\u2022 Inspection. All the estimator\u2019s hyperparameters are accessible directly via public\ninstance variables (e.g., imputer.strategy), and all the estimator\u2019s learned\nparameters are also accessible via public instance variables with an underscore\nsuffix (e.g., imputer.statistics_).\n\u2022 Nonproliferation of classes. Datasets are represented as NumPy arrays or SciPy\nsparse matrices, instead of homemade classes. Hyperparameters are just regular\nPython strings or numbers.\n\u2022 Composition. Existing building blocks are reused as much as possible. For\nexample, it is easy to create a Pipeline estimator from an arbitrary sequence of\ntransformers followed by a final estimator, as we will see.\n\u2022 Sensible defaults. Scikit-Learn provides reasonable default values for most\nparameters, making it easy to create a baseline working system quickly.\nPrepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms\n|\n20 Before Scikit-Learn 0.20, it could only encode integer categorical values, but since 0.20 it can also handle\nother types of inputs, including text categorical inputs.\n>>> housing_cat_encoded = ordinal_encoder.fit_transform(housing_cat)\n>>> housing_cat_encoded[:10]\narray([[0.],\n[0.],\n[4.],\n[1.],\n[0.],\n[1.],\n[0.],\n[1.],\n[0.],\n[0.]])\nYou can get the list of categories using the categories_ instance variable. It is a list\ncontaining a 1D array of categories for each categorical attribute (in this case, a list\ncontaining a single array since there is just one categorical attribute):\n>>> ordinal_encoder.categories_\n[array(['<1H OCEAN', 'INLAND', 'ISLAND', 'NEAR BAY', 'NEAR OCEAN'],\ndtype=object)]\nOne issue with this representation is that ML algorithms will assume that two nearby\nvalues are more similar than two distant values. This may be fine in some cases (e.g.,\nfor ordered categories such as \u201cbad\u201d\n, \u201caverage\u201d\n, \u201cgood\u201d\n, \u201cexcellent\u201d), but it is obviously\nnot the case for the ocean_proximity column (for example, categories 0 and 4 are\nclearly more similar than categories 0 and 1). To fix this issue, a common solution is\nto create one binary attribute per category: one attribute equal to 1 when the category\nis \u201c<1H OCEAN\u201d (and 0 otherwise), another attribute equal to 1 when the category is\n\u201cINLAND\u201d (and 0 otherwise), and so on. This is called one-hot encoding, because\nonly one attribute will be equal to 1 (hot), while the others will be 0 (cold). The new\nattributes are sometimes called dummy attributes. Scikit-Learn provides a OneHotEn\ncoder class to convert categorical values into one-hot vectors20:\n>>> from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\n>>> cat_encoder = OneHotEncoder()\n>>> housing_cat_1hot = cat_encoder.fit_transform(housing_cat)\n>>> housing_cat_1hot\n<16512x5 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.float64'>'\nwith 16512 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>\nNotice that the output is a SciPy sparse matrix, instead of a NumPy array. This is very\nuseful when you have categorical attributes with thousands of categories. After one-\nhot encoding we get a matrix with thousands of columns, and the matrix is full of\nzeros except for a single 1 per row. Using up tons of memory mostly to store zeros\nwould be very wasteful, so instead a sparse matrix only stores the location of the non\u2010\n|\nChapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project\n21 See SciPy\u2019s documentation for more details.\nzero elements. You can use it mostly like a normal 2D array,21 but if you really want to\nconvert it to a (dense) NumPy array, just call the toarray() method:\n>>> housing_cat_1hot.toarray()\narray([[1., 0., 0., 0., 0.],\n[1., 0., 0., 0., 0.],\n[0., 0., 0., 0., 1.],\n...,\n[0., 1., 0., 0., 0.],\n[1., 0., 0., 0., 0.],\n[0., 0., 0., 1., 0.]])\nOnce again, you can get the list of categories using the encoder\u2019s categories_\ninstance variable:\n>>> cat_encoder.categories_\n[array(['<1H OCEAN', 'INLAND', 'ISLAND', 'NEAR BAY', 'NEAR OCEAN'],\ndtype=object)]\nIf a categorical attribute has a large number of possible categories\n(e.g., country code, profession, species, etc.), then one-hot encod\u2010\ning will result in a large number of input features. This may slow\ndown training and degrade performance. If this happens, you may\nwant to replace the categorical input with useful numerical features\nrelated to the categories: for example, you could replace the\nocean_proximity feature with the distance to the ocean (similarly,\na country code could be replaced with the country\u2019s population and\nGDP per capita). Alternatively, you could replace each category\nwith a learnable low dimensional vector called an embedding. Each\ncategory\u2019s representation would be learned during training: this is\nan example of representation learning (see Chapter 13 and ??? for\nmore details).\nPrepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms\n|\nmatic hyperparameter tuning. For example, here is a small transformer class that adds\nthe combined attributes we discussed earlier:\nfrom sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin\nrooms_ix, bedrooms_ix, population_ix, households_ix = 3, 4, 5, 6\nclass CombinedAttributesAdder(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):\ndef __init__(self, add_bedrooms_per_room = True): # no *args or **kargs\nself.add_bedrooms_per_room = add_bedrooms_per_room\ndef fit(self, X, y=None):\nreturn self  # nothing else to do\ndef transform(self, X, y=None):\nrooms_per_household = X[:, rooms_ix] / X[:, households_ix]\npopulation_per_household = X[:, population_ix] / X[:, households_ix]\nif self.add_bedrooms_per_room:\nbedrooms_per_room = X[:, bedrooms_ix] / X[:, rooms_ix]\nreturn np.c_[X, rooms_per_household, population_per_household,\nbedrooms_per_room]\nelse:\nreturn np.c_[X, rooms_per_household, population_per_household]\nattr_adder = CombinedAttributesAdder(add_bedrooms_per_room=False)\nhousing_extra_attribs = attr_adder.transform(housing.values)\nIn this example the transformer has one hyperparameter, add_bedrooms_per_room,\nset to True by default (it is often helpful to provide sensible defaults). This hyperpara\u2010\nmeter will allow you to easily find out whether adding this attribute helps the\nMachine Learning algorithms or not. More generally, you can add a hyperparameter\nto gate any data preparation step that you are not 100% sure about. The more you\nautomate these data preparation steps, the more combinations you can automatically\ntry out, making it much more likely that you will find a great combination (and sav\u2010\ning you a lot of time).\nPrepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms\n|\n22 Just like for pipelines, the name can be anything as long as it does not contain double underscores.\nThe pipeline exposes the same methods as the final estimator. In this example, the last\nestimator is a StandardScaler, which is a transformer, so the pipeline has a trans\nform() method that applies all the transforms to the data in sequence (and of course\nalso a fit_transform() method, which is the one we used).\nSo far, we have handled the categorical columns and the numerical columns sepa\u2010\nrately. It would be more convenient to have a single transformer able to handle all col\u2010\numns, applying the appropriate transformations to each column. In version 0.20,\nScikit-Learn introduced the ColumnTransformer for this purpose, and the good news\nis that it works great with Pandas DataFrames. Let\u2019s use it to apply all the transforma\u2010\ntions to the housing data:\nfrom sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\nnum_attribs = list(housing_num)\ncat_attribs = [\"ocean_proximity\"]\nfull_pipeline = ColumnTransformer([\n(\"num\", num_pipeline, num_attribs),\n(\"cat\", OneHotEncoder(), cat_attribs),\n])\nhousing_prepared = full_pipeline.fit_transform(housing)\nHere is how this works: first we import the ColumnTransformer class, next we get the\nlist of numerical column names and the list of categorical column names, and we\nconstruct a ColumnTransformer. The constructor requires a list of tuples, where each\ntuple contains a name22, a transformer and a list of names (or indices) of columns\nthat the transformer should be applied to. In this example, we specify that the numer\u2010\nical columns should be transformed using the num_pipeline that we defined earlier,\nand the categorical columns should be transformed using a OneHotEncoder. Finally,\nwe apply this ColumnTransformer to the housing data: it applies each transformer to\nthe appropriate columns and concatenates the outputs along the second axis (the\ntransformers must return the same number of rows).\nNote that the OneHotEncoder returns a sparse matrix, while the num_pipeline returns\na dense matrix. When there is such a mix of sparse and dense matrices, the Colum\nnTransformer estimates the density of the final matrix (i.e., the ratio of non-zero\ncells), and it returns a sparse matrix if the density is lower than a given threshold (by\ndefault, sparse_threshold=0.3). In this example, it returns a dense matrix. And\nthat\u2019s it! We have a preprocessing pipeline that takes the full housing data and applies\nthe appropriate transformations to each column.\n|\nChapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project\nInstead of a transformer, you can specify the string \"drop\" if you\nwant the columns to be dropped. Or you can specify \"pass\nthrough\" if you want the columns to be left untouched. By default,\nthe remaining columns (i.e., the ones that were not listed) will be\ndropped, but you can set the remainder hyperparameter to any\ntransformer (or to \"passthrough\") if you want these columns to be\nhandled differently.\nIf you are using Scikit-Learn 0.19 or earlier, you can use a third-party library such as\nsklearn-pandas, or roll out your own custom transformer to get the same function\u2010\nality as the ColumnTransformer. Alternatively, you can use the FeatureUnion class\nwhich can also apply different transformers and concatenate their outputs, but you\ncannot specify different columns for each transformer, they all apply to the whole\ndata. It is possible to work around this limitation using a custom transformer for col\u2010\numn selection (see the Jupyter notebook for an example).",

With few exceptions, Machine Learning algorithms don\u2019t perform well when\nthe input numerical attributes have very different scales. This is the case for the hous\u2010\ning data: the total number of rooms ranges from about 6 to 39,320, while the median\nincomes only range from 0 to 15. Note that scaling the target values is generally not\nrequired.\nThere are two common ways to get all attributes to have the same scale: min-max\nscaling and standardization.\nMin-max scaling (many people call this normalization) is quite simple: values are\nshifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging from 0 to 1. We do this by subtract\u2010\ning the min value and dividing by the max minus the min. Scikit-Learn provides a\n|\nChapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project\ntransformer called MinMaxScaler for this. It has a feature_range hyperparameter\nthat lets you change the range if you don\u2019t want 0\u20131 for some reason.\nStandardization is quite different: first it subtracts the mean value (so standardized\nvalues always have a zero mean), and then it divides by the standard deviation so that\nthe resulting distribution has unit variance. Unlike min-max scaling, standardization\ndoes not bound values to a specific range, which may be a problem for some algo\u2010\nrithms (e.g., neural networks often expect an input value ranging from 0 to 1). How\u2010\never, standardization is much less affected by outliers. For example, suppose a district\nhad a median income equal to 100 (by mistake). Min-max scaling would then crush\nall the other values from 0\u201315 down to 0\u20130.15, whereas standardization would not be\nmuch affected. Scikit-Learn provides a transformer called StandardScaler for stand\u2010\nardization.\nAs with all the transformations, it is important to fit the scalers to\nthe training data only, not to the full dataset (including the test set).\nOnly then can you use them to transform the training set and the\ntest set (and new data).",

When this happens it can mean that the features do not provide\nenough information to make good predictions, or that the model is not powerful\nenough.

As we will see in Chap\u2010\nter 7, Random Forests work by training many Decision Trees on random subsets of\nthe features, then averaging out their predictions. Building a model on top of many\nother models is called Ensemble Learning, and it is often a great way to push ML algo\u2010\nrithms even further. We will skip most of the code since it is essentially the same as\nfor the other models:\n>>> from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n>>> forest_reg = RandomForestRegressor()\n>>> forest_reg.fit(housing_prepared, housing_labels)\n>>> [...]\n>>> forest_rmse\n18603.515021376355\n>>> display_scores(forest_rmse_scores)\nScores: [49519.80364233 47461.9115823  50029.02762854 52325.28068953\n49308.39426421 53446.37892622 48634.8036574  47585.73832311\n53490.10699751 50021.5852922 ]\nMean: 50182.303100336096\nStandard deviation: 2097.0810550985693\nWow, this is much better: Random Forests look very promising. However, note that\nthe score on the training set is still much lower than on the validation sets, meaning\nthat the model is still overfitting the training set. Possible solutions for overfitting are\nto simplify the model, constrain it (i.e., regularize it), or get a lot more training data.\nHowever, before you dive much deeper in Random Forests, you should try out many\nother models from various categories of Machine Learning algorithms (several Sup\u2010\nport Vector Machines with different kernels, possibly a neural network, etc.), without\nspending too much time tweaking the hyperparameters. The goal is to shortlist a few\n(two to five) promising models.\n|\nChapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project\nYou should save every model you experiment with, so you can\ncome back easily to any model you want. Make sure you save both\nthe hyperparameters and the trained parameters, as well as the\ncross-validation scores and perhaps the actual predictions as well.\nThis will allow you to easily compare scores across model types,\nand compare the types of errors they make. You can easily save\nScikit-Learn models by using Python\u2019s pickle module, or using\nsklearn.externals.joblib, which is more efficient at serializing\nlarge NumPy arrays:\nfrom sklearn.externals import joblib\njoblib.dump(my_model, \"my_model.pkl\")\n# and later...\nmy_model_loaded = joblib.load(\"my_model.pkl\")",

It\u2019s a bit of work, but nothing too difficult and it would work fairly well.\nA great alternative is to use Scikit-Learn\u2019s K-fold cross-validation feature. The follow\u2010\ning code randomly splits the training set into 10 distinct subsets called folds, then it\ntrains and evaluates the Decision Tree model 10 times, picking a different fold for\nevaluation every time and training on the other 9 folds. The result is an array con\u2010\ntaining the 10 evaluation scores:\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\nscores = cross_val_score(tree_reg, housing_prepared, housing_labels,\nscoring=\"neg_mean_squared_error\", cv=10)\ntree_rmse_scores = np.sqrt(-scores)\nScikit-Learn\u2019s cross-validation features expect a utility function\n(greater is better) rather than a cost function (lower is better), so\nthe scoring function is actually the opposite of the MSE (i.e., a neg\u2010\native value), which is why the preceding code computes -scores\nbefore calculating the square root.\nLet\u2019s look at the results:\n>>> def display_scores(scores):\n...     print(\"Scores:\", scores)\n...     print(\"Mean:\", scores.mean())\n...     print(\"Standard deviation:\", scores.std())\n...\n>>> display_scores(tree_rmse_scores)\nScores: [70194.33680785 66855.16363941 72432.58244769 70758.73896782\n71115.88230639 75585.14172901 70262.86139133 70273.6325285\n75366.87952553 71231.65726027]\nMean: 71407.68766037929\nStandard deviation: 2439.4345041191004\nNow the Decision Tree doesn\u2019t look as good as it did earlier.

Let\u2019s look at a few ways you can do that.\nFine-Tune Your Model\n|\nWhen you have no idea what value a hyperparameter should have,\na simple approach is to try out consecutive powers of 10 (or a\nsmaller number if you want a more fine-grained search, as shown\nin this example with the n_estimators hyperparameter).\nThis param_grid tells Scikit-Learn to first evaluate all 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 combinations of\nn_estimators and max_features hyperparameter values specified in the first dict\n(don\u2019t worry about what these hyperparameters mean for now; they will be explained\nin Chapter 7), then try all 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 combinations of hyperparameter values in the\nsecond dict, but this time with the bootstrap hyperparameter set to False instead of\nTrue (which is the default value for this hyperparameter).\nAll in all, the grid search will explore 12 + 6 = 18 combinations of RandomForestRe\ngressor hyperparameter values, and it will train each model five times (since we are\nusing five-fold cross validation). In other words, all in all, there will be 18 \u00d7 5 = 90\nrounds of training! It may take quite a long time, but when it is done you can get the\nbest combination of parameters like this:\n>>> grid_search.best_params_\n{'max_features': 8, 'n_estimators': 30}\nSince 8 and 30 are the maximum values that were evaluated, you\nshould probably try searching again with higher values, since the\nscore may continue to improve.\nYou can also get the best estimator directly:\n>>> grid_search.best_estimator_\nRandomForestRegressor(bootstrap=True, criterion='mse', max_depth=None,\nmax_features=8, max_leaf_nodes=None, min_impurity_decrease=0.0,\nmin_impurity_split=None, min_samples_leaf=1,\nmin_samples_split=2, min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0,\nn_estimators=30, n_jobs=None, oob_score=False, random_state=None,\nverbose=0, warm_start=False)\nIf GridSearchCV is initialized with refit=True (which is the\ndefault), then once it finds the best estimator using cross-\nvalidation, it retrains it on the whole training set. This is usually a\ngood idea since feeding it more data will likely improve its perfor\u2010\nmance.\nAnd of course the evaluation scores are also available:\n>>> cvres = grid_search.cv_results_\n>>> for mean_score, params in zip(cvres[\"mean_test_score\"], cvres[\"params\"]):\n|\nChapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project\n...     print(np.sqrt(-mean_score), params)\n...\n63669.05791727153 {'max_features': 2, 'n_estimators': 3}\n55627.16171305252 {'max_features': 2, 'n_estimators': 10}\n53384.57867637289 {'max_features': 2, 'n_estimators': 30}\n60965.99185930139 {'max_features': 4, 'n_estimators': 3}\n52740.98248528835 {'max_features': 4, 'n_estimators': 10}\n50377.344409590376 {'max_features': 4, 'n_estimators': 30}\n58663.84733372485 {'max_features': 6, 'n_estimators': 3}\n52006.15355973719 {'max_features': 6, 'n_estimators': 10}\n50146.465964159885 {'max_features': 6, 'n_estimators': 30}\n57869.25504027614 {'max_features': 8, 'n_estimators': 3}\n51711.09443660957 {'max_features': 8, 'n_estimators': 10}\n49682.25345942335 {'max_features': 8, 'n_estimators': 30}\n62895.088889905004 {'bootstrap': False, 'max_features': 2, 'n_estimators': 3}\n54658.14484390074 {'bootstrap': False, 'max_features': 2, 'n_estimators': 10}\n59470.399594730654 {'bootstrap': False, 'max_features': 3, 'n_estimators': 3}\n52725.01091081235 {'bootstrap': False, 'max_features': 3, 'n_estimators': 10}\n57490.612956065226 {'bootstrap': False, 'max_features': 4, 'n_estimators': 3}\n51009.51445842374 {'bootstrap': False, 'max_features': 4, 'n_estimators': 10}\nIn this example, we obtain the best solution by setting the max_features hyperpara\u2010\nmeter to 8, and the n_estimators hyperparameter to 30. The RMSE score for this\ncombination is 49,682, which is slightly better than the score you got earlier using the\ndefault hyperparameter values (which was 50,182). Congratulations, you have suc\u2010\ncessfully fine-tuned your best model!\nDon\u2019t forget that you can treat some of the data preparation steps as\nhyperparameters. For example, the grid search will automatically\nfind out whether or not to add a feature you were not sure about\n(e.g., using the add_bedrooms_per_room hyperparameter of your\nCombinedAttributesAdder transformer). It may similarly be used\nto automatically find the best way to handle outliers, missing fea\u2010\ntures, feature selection, and more.\nFine-Tune Your Model\n|\n\u2022 If you let the randomized search run for, say, 1,000 iterations, this approach will\nexplore 1,000 different values for each hyperparameter (instead of just a few val\u2010\nues per hyperparameter with the grid search approach).\n\u2022 You have more control over the computing budget you want to allocate to hyper\u2010\nparameter search, simply by setting the number of iterations.\nFine-Tune Your Model\n|\non unknown datasets). It is not the case in this example, but when this happens you\nmust resist the temptation to tweak the hyperparameters to make the numbers look\ngood on the test set; the improvements would be unlikely to generalize to new data.\nNow comes the project prelaunch phase: you need to present your solution (high\u2010\nlighting what you have learned, what worked and what did not, what assumptions\nwere made, and what your system\u2019s limitations are), document everything, and create\nnice presentations with clear visualizations and easy-to-remember statements (e.g.,\n\u201cthe median income is the number one predictor of housing prices\u201d). In this Califor\u2010\nnia housing example, the final performance of the system is not better than the\nexperts\u2019\n, but it may still be a good idea to launch it, especially if this frees up some\ntime for the experts so they can work on more interesting and productive tasks.",

You need to get your solution ready for produc\u2010\ntion, in particular by plugging the production input data sources into your system\nand writing tests.\nYou also need to write monitoring code to check your system\u2019s live performance at\nregular intervals and trigger alerts when it drops. This is important to catch not only\nsudden breakage, but also performance degradation. This is quite common because\nmodels tend to \u201crot\u201d as data evolves over time, unless the models are regularly trained\non fresh data.\nEvaluating your system\u2019s performance will require sampling the system\u2019s predictions\nand evaluating them. This will generally require a human analysis. These analysts\nmay be field experts, or workers on a crowdsourcing platform (such as Amazon\nMechanical Turk or CrowdFlower). Either way, you need to plug the human evalua\u2010\ntion pipeline into your system.\nYou should also make sure you evaluate the system\u2019s input data quality. Sometimes\nperformance will degrade slightly because of a poor quality signal (e.g., a malfunc\u2010\ntioning sensor sending random values, or another team\u2019s output becoming stale), but\nit may take a while before your system\u2019s performance degrades enough to trigger an\nalert. If you monitor your system\u2019s inputs, you may catch this earlier. Monitoring the\ninputs is particularly important for online learning systems.\nFinally, you will generally want to train your models on a regular basis using fresh\ndata. You should automate this process as much as possible. If you don\u2019t, you are very\nlikely to refresh your model only every six months (at best), and your system\u2019s perfor\u2010\nmance may fluctuate severely over time. If your system is an online learning system,\nyou should make sure you save snapshots of its state at regular intervals so you can\neasily roll back to a previously working state.\n|\nChapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project",

This set has been stud\u2010\nied so much that it is often called the \u201cHello World\u201d of Machine Learning: whenever\npeople come up with a new classification algorithm, they are curious to see how it\nwill perform on MNIST. Whenever someone learns Machine Learning, sooner or\nlater they tackle MNIST.\nScikit-Learn provides many helper functions to download popular datasets. MNIST is\none of them. The following code fetches the MNIST dataset:1\n>>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml\n>>> mnist = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1)\n>>> mnist.keys()\ndict_keys(['data', 'target', 'feature_names', 'DESCR', 'details',\n'categories', 'url'])\nDatasets loaded by Scikit-Learn generally have a similar dictionary structure includ\u2010\ning:\n\u2022 A DESCR key describing the dataset\n\u2022 A data key containing an array with one row per instance and one column per\nfeature\n\u2022 A target key containing an array with the labels\nLet\u2019s look at these arrays:\n>>> X, y = mnist[\"data\"], mnist[\"target\"]\n>>> X.shape\n(70000, 784)\n>>> y.shape\n(70000,)\nThere are 70,000 images, and each image has 784 features.

There are many performance\n|\nChapter 3: Classification\nmeasures available, so grab another coffee and get ready to learn many new concepts\nand acronyms!\nPerformance Measures\n|\n>>> from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n>>> cross_val_score(sgd_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3, scoring=\"accuracy\")\narray([0.96355, 0.93795, 0.95615])\nWow! Above 93% accuracy (ratio of correct predictions) on all cross-validation folds?\nThis looks amazing, doesn\u2019t it? Well, before you get too excited, let\u2019s look at a very\ndumb classifier that just classifies every single image in the \u201cnot-5\u201d class:\nfrom sklearn.base import BaseEstimator\nclass Never5Classifier(BaseEstimator):\ndef fit(self, X, y=None):\npass\ndef predict(self, X):\nreturn np.zeros((len(X), 1), dtype=bool)\nCan you guess this model\u2019s accuracy? Let\u2019s find out:\n>>> never_5_clf = Never5Classifier()\n>>> cross_val_score(never_5_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3, scoring=\"accuracy\")\narray([0.91125, 0.90855, 0.90915])\nThat\u2019s right, it has over 90% accuracy! This is simply because only about 10% of the\nimages are 5s, so if you always guess that an image is not a 5, you will be right about\n90% of the time. Beats Nostradamus.\nThis demonstrates why accuracy is generally not the preferred performance measure\nfor classifiers, especially when you are dealing with skewed datasets (i.e., when some\nclasses are much more frequent than others).\nPerformance Measures\n|\n(TPR): this is the ratio of positive instances that are correctly detected by the classifier\n(Equation 3-2).\nEquation 3-2. Recall\nrecall =\nTP\nTP + FN\nFN is of course the number of false negatives.\nIf you are confused about the confusion matrix, Figure 3-2 may help.\nFigure 3-2. An illustrated confusion matrix\nPerformance Measures\n|\nFigure 3-3. Decision threshold and precision/recall tradeoff\nScikit-Learn does not let you set the threshold directly, but it does give you access to\nthe decision scores that it uses to make predictions. Instead of calling the classifier\u2019s\npredict() method, you can call its decision_function() method, which returns a\nscore for each instance, and then make predictions based on those scores using any\nthreshold you want:\n>>> y_scores = sgd_clf.decision_function([some_digit])\n>>> y_scores\narray([2412.53175101])\n>>> threshold = 0\n>>> y_some_digit_pred = (y_scores > threshold)\narray([ True])\nThe SGDClassifier uses a threshold equal to 0, so the previous code returns the same\nresult as the predict() method (i.e., True). Let\u2019s raise the threshold:\n>>> threshold = 8000\n>>> y_some_digit_pred = (y_scores > threshold)\n>>> y_some_digit_pred\narray([False])\nThis confirms that raising the threshold decreases recall. The image actually repre\u2010\nsents a 5, and the classifier detects it when the threshold is 0, but it misses it when the\nthreshold is increased to 8,000.\nNow how do you decide which threshold to use? For this you will first need to get the\nscores of all instances in the training set using the cross_val_predict() function\nagain, but this time specifying that you want it to return decision scores instead of\npredictions:\ny_scores = cross_val_predict(sgd_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3,\nmethod=\"decision_function\")\nNow with these scores you can compute precision and recall for all possible thresh\u2010\nolds using the precision_recall_curve() function:\n|\nChapter 3: Classification\nfrom sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve\nprecisions, recalls, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_train_5, y_scores)\nFinally, you can plot precision and recall as functions of the threshold value using\nMatplotlib (Figure 3-4):\ndef plot_precision_recall_vs_threshold(precisions, recalls, thresholds):\nplt.plot(thresholds, precisions[:-1], \"b--\", label=\"Precision\")\nplt.plot(thresholds, recalls[:-1], \"g-\", label=\"Recall\")\n[...] # highlight the threshold, add the legend, axis label and grid\nplot_precision_recall_vs_threshold(precisions, recalls, thresholds)\nplt.show()\nFigure 3-4. Precision and recall versus the decision threshold\nYou may wonder why the precision curve is bumpier than the recall\ncurve in Figure 3-4. The reason is that precision may sometimes go\ndown when you raise the threshold (although in general it will go\nup). To understand why, look back at Figure 3-3 and notice what\nhappens when you start from the central threshold and move it just\none digit to the right: precision goes from 4/5 (80%) down to 3/4\n(75%). On the other hand, recall can only go down when the thres\u2010\nhold is increased, which explains why its curve looks smooth.\nAnother way to select a good precision/recall tradeoff is to plot precision directly\nagainst recall, as shown in Figure 3-5 (the same threshold as earlier is highlighed).\nPerformance Measures\n|\nFigure 3-5. Precision versus recall\nYou can see that precision really starts to fall sharply around 80% recall. You will\nprobably want to select a precision/recall tradeoff just before that drop\u2014for example,\nat around 60% recall. But of course the choice depends on your project.\nSo let\u2019s suppose you decide to aim for 90% precision. You look up the first plot and\nfind that you need to use a threshold of about 8,000. To be more precise you can\nsearch for the lowest threshold that gives you at least 90% precision (np.argmax()\nwill give us the first index of the maximum value, which in this case means the first\nTrue value):\nthreshold_90_precision = thresholds[np.argmax(precisions >= 0.90)] # ~7816\nTo make predictions (on the training set for now), instead of calling the classifier\u2019s\npredict() method, you can just run this code:\ny_train_pred_90 = (y_scores >= threshold_90_precision)\nLet\u2019s check these predictions\u2019 precision and recall:\n>>> precision_score(y_train_5, y_train_pred_90)\n0.9000380083618396\n>>> recall_score(y_train_5, y_train_pred_90)\n0.4368197749492714\nGreat, you have a 90% precision classifier ! As you can see, it is fairly easy to create a\nclassifier with virtually any precision you want: just set a high enough threshold, and\nyou\u2019re done. Hmm, not so fast. A high-precision classifier is not very useful if its\nrecall is too low!\n|\nChapter 3: Classification\nIf someone says \u201clet\u2019s reach 99% precision,\u201d you should ask, \u201cat\nwhat recall?\u201d\nPerformance Measures\n|\nFigure 3-6. ROC curve\nOnce again there is a tradeoff: the higher the recall (TPR), the more false positives\n(FPR) the classifier produces. The dotted line represents the ROC curve of a purely\nrandom classifier; a good classifier stays as far away from that line as possible (toward\nthe top-left corner).\nOne way to compare classifiers is to measure the area under the curve (AUC). A per\u2010\nfect classifier will have a ROC AUC equal to 1, whereas a purely random classifier will\nhave a ROC AUC equal to 0.5. Scikit-Learn provides a function to compute the ROC\nAUC:\n>>> from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\n>>> roc_auc_score(y_train_5, y_scores)\n0.9611778893101814\nSince the ROC curve is so similar to the precision/recall (or PR)\ncurve, you may wonder how to decide which one to use. As a rule\nof thumb, you should prefer the PR curve whenever the positive\nclass is rare or when you care more about the false positives than\nthe false negatives, and the ROC curve otherwise. For example,\nlooking at the previous ROC curve (and the ROC AUC score), you\nmay think that the classifier is really good. But this is mostly\nbecause there are few positives (5s) compared to the negatives\n(non-5s). In contrast, the PR curve makes it clear that the classifier\nhas room for improvement (the curve could be closer to the top-\nright corner).\n|\nChapter 3: Classification\nLet\u2019s train a RandomForestClassifier and compare its ROC curve and ROC AUC\nscore to the SGDClassifier. First, you need to get scores for each instance in the\ntraining set. But due to the way it works (see Chapter 7), the RandomForestClassi\nfier class does not have a decision_function() method. Instead it has a pre\ndict_proba() method. Scikit-Learn classifiers generally have one or the other. The\npredict_proba() method returns an array containing a row per instance and a col\u2010\numn per class, each containing the probability that the given instance belongs to the\ngiven class (e.g., 70% chance that the image represents a 5):\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nforest_clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)\ny_probas_forest = cross_val_predict(forest_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3,\nmethod=\"predict_proba\")\nBut to plot a ROC curve, you need scores, not probabilities. A simple solution is to\nuse the positive class\u2019s probability as the score:\ny_scores_forest = y_probas_forest[:, 1]   # score = proba of positive class\nfpr_forest, tpr_forest, thresholds_forest = roc_curve(y_train_5,y_scores_forest)\nNow you are ready to plot the ROC curve. It is useful to plot the first ROC curve as\nwell to see how they compare (Figure 3-7):\nplt.plot(fpr, tpr, \"b:\", label=\"SGD\")\nplot_roc_curve(fpr_forest, tpr_forest, \"Random Forest\")\nplt.legend(loc=\"lower right\")\nplt.show()\nFigure 3-7. Comparing ROC curves\nPerformance Measures\n|\nAs you can see in Figure 3-7, the RandomForestClassifier\u2019s ROC curve looks much\nbetter than the SGDClassifier\u2019s: it comes much closer to the top-left corner. As a\nresult, its ROC AUC score is also significantly better:\n>>> roc_auc_score(y_train_5, y_scores_forest)\n0.9983436731328145\nTry measuring the precision and recall scores: you should find 99.0% precision and\n86.6% recall. Not too bad!\nHopefully you now know how to train binary classifiers, choose the appropriate met\u2010\nric for your task, evaluate your classifiers using cross-validation, select the precision/\nrecall tradeoff that fits your needs, and compare various models using ROC curves\nand ROC AUC scores.

In these cases, you can implement cross-\nvalidation yourself; it is actually fairly straightforward. The following code does\nroughly the same thing as Scikit-Learn\u2019s cross_val_score() function, and prints the\nsame result:\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.base import clone\nskfolds = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=3, random_state=42)\nfor train_index, test_index in skfolds.split(X_train, y_train_5):\nclone_clf = clone(sgd_clf)\nX_train_folds = X_train[train_index]\ny_train_folds = y_train_5[train_index]\nX_test_fold = X_train[test_index]\ny_test_fold = y_train_5[test_index]\nclone_clf.fit(X_train_folds, y_train_folds)\ny_pred = clone_clf.predict(X_test_fold)\nn_correct = sum(y_pred == y_test_fold)\nprint(n_correct / len(y_pred))  # prints 0.9502, 0.96565 and 0.96495\nThe StratifiedKFold class performs stratified sampling (as explained in Chapter 2)\nto produce folds that contain a representative ratio of each class. At each iteration the\ncode creates a clone of the classifier, trains that clone on the training folds, and makes\npredictions on the test fold. Then it counts the number of correct predictions and\noutputs the ratio of correct predictions.\nLet\u2019s use the cross_val_score() function to evaluate your SGDClassifier model\nusing K-fold cross-validation, with three folds. Remember that K-fold cross-\nvalidation means splitting the training set into K-folds (in this case, three), then mak\u2010\ning predictions and evaluating them on each fold using a model trained on the\nremaining folds (see Chapter 2):",

The first row of this matrix considers non-5 images (the nega\u2010\ntive class): 53,057 of them were correctly classified as non-5s (they are called true\nnegatives), while the remaining 1,522 were wrongly classified as 5s (false positives).\nThe second row considers the images of 5s (the positive class): 1,325 were wrongly\nclassified as non-5s (false negatives), while the remaining 4,096 were correctly classi\u2010\nfied as 5s (true positives). A perfect classifier would have only true positives and true\nnegatives, so its confusion matrix would have nonzero values only on its main diago\u2010\nnal (top left to bottom right):\n>>> y_train_perfect_predictions = y_train_5  # pretend we reached perfection\n>>> confusion_matrix(y_train_5, y_train_perfect_predictions)\narray([[54579,     0],\n[    0,  5421]])\nThe confusion matrix gives you a lot of information, but sometimes you may prefer a\nmore concise metric. An interesting one to look at is the accuracy of the positive pre\u2010\ndictions; this is called the precision of the classifier (Equation 3-1).\nEquation 3-1. Precision\nprecision =\nTP\nTP + FP\nTP is the number of true positives, and FP is the number of false positives.\nA trivial way to have perfect precision is to make one single positive prediction and\nensure it is correct (precision = 1/1 = 100%). This would not be very useful since the\nclassifier would ignore all but one positive instance. So precision is typically used\nalong with another metric named recall, also called sensitivity or true positive rate",

More\u2010\nover, it only detects 75.6% of the 5s.\nIt is often convenient to combine precision and recall into a single metric called the F1\nscore, in particular if you need a simple way to compare two classifiers. The F1 score is\nthe harmonic mean of precision and recall (Equation 3-3). Whereas the regular mean\n|\nChapter 3: Classification\ntreats all values equally, the harmonic mean gives much more weight to low values.\nAs a result, the classifier will only get a high F1 score if both recall and precision are\nhigh.\nEquation 3-3.

On the other hand, suppose you train a classifier to detect\nshoplifters on surveillance images: it is probably fine if your classifier has only 30%\nprecision as long as it has 99% recall (sure, the security guards will get a few false\nalerts, but almost all shoplifters will get caught).\nUnfortunately, you can\u2019t have it both ways: increasing precision reduces recall, and\nvice versa.

                    "content": "\nMulticlass Classification\nWhereas binary classifiers distinguish between two classes, multiclass classifiers (also\ncalled multinomial classifiers) can distinguish between more than two classes.\nSome algorithms (such as Random Forest classifiers or naive Bayes classifiers) are\ncapable of handling multiple classes directly. Others (such as Support Vector Machine\nclassifiers or Linear classifiers) are strictly binary classifiers. However, there are vari\u2010\nous strategies that you can use to perform multiclass classification using multiple\nbinary classifiers.\nFor example, one way to create a system that can classify the digit images into 10\nclasses (from 0 to 9) is to train 10 binary classifiers, one for each digit (a 0-detector, a\n1-detector, a 2-detector, and so on). Then when you want to classify an image, you get\nthe decision score from each classifier for that image and you select the class whose\nclassifier outputs the highest score. This is called the one-versus-all (OvA) strategy\n(also called one-versus-the-rest).\nAnother strategy is to train a binary classifier for every pair of digits: one to distin\u2010\nguish 0s and 1s, another to distinguish 0s and 2s, another for 1s and 2s, and so on.\nThis is called the one-versus-one (OvO) strategy. If there are N classes, you need to\ntrain N \u00d7 (N \u2013 1) / 2 classifiers. For the MNIST problem, this means training 45\nbinary classifiers! When you want to classify an image, you have to run the image\nthrough all 45 classifiers and see which class wins the most duels. The main advan\u2010\ntage of OvO is that each classifier only needs to be trained on the part of the training\nset for the two classes that it must distinguish.\nSome algorithms (such as Support Vector Machine classifiers) scale poorly with the\nsize of the training set, so for these algorithms OvO is preferred since it is faster to\ntrain many classifiers on small training sets than training few classifiers on large\ntraining sets. For most binary classification algorithms, however, OvA is preferred.\n|\nChapter 3: Classification\nScikit-Learn detects when you try to use a binary classification algorithm for a multi\u2010\nclass classification task, and it automatically runs OvA (except for SVM classifiers for\nwhich it uses OvO). Let\u2019s try this with the SGDClassifier:\n>>> sgd_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)  # y_train, not y_train_5\n>>> sgd_clf.predict([some_digit])\narray([5], dtype=uint8)\nThat was easy! This code trains the SGDClassifier on the training set using the origi\u2010\nnal target classes from 0 to 9 (y_train), instead of the 5-versus-all target classes\n(y_train_5). Then it makes a prediction (a correct one in this case). Under the hood,\nScikit-Learn actually trained 10 binary classifiers, got their decision scores for the\nimage, and selected the class with the highest score.\nTo see that this is indeed the case, you can call the decision_function() method.\nInstead of returning just one score per instance, it now returns 10 scores, one per\nclass:\n>>> some_digit_scores = sgd_clf.decision_function([some_digit])\n>>> some_digit_scores\narray([[-15955.22627845, -38080.96296175, -13326.66694897,\n573.52692379, -17680.6846644 ,   2412.53175101,\n-25526.86498156, -12290.15704709,  -7946.05205023,\n-10631.35888549]])\nThe highest score is indeed the one corresponding to class 5:\n>>> np.argmax(some_digit_scores)\n>>> sgd_clf.classes_\narray([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], dtype=uint8)\n>>> sgd_clf.classes_[5]\nWhen a classifier is trained, it stores the list of target classes in its\nclasses_ attribute, ordered by value. In this case, the index of each\nclass in the classes_ array conveniently matches the class itself\n(e.g., the class at index 5 happens to be class 5), but in general you\nwon\u2019t be so lucky.\nIf you want to force ScikitLearn to use one-versus-one or one-versus-all, you can use\nthe OneVsOneClassifier or OneVsRestClassifier classes. Simply create an instance\nand pass a binary classifier to its constructor. For example, this code creates a multi\u2010\nclass classifier using the OvO strategy, based on a SGDClassifier:\n>>> from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsOneClassifier\n>>> ovo_clf = OneVsOneClassifier(SGDClassifier(random_state=42))\n>>> ovo_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n>>> ovo_clf.predict([some_digit])\nMulticlass Classification\n|\narray([5], dtype=uint8)\n>>> len(ovo_clf.estimators_)\nTraining a RandomForestClassifier is just as easy:\n>>> forest_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n>>> forest_clf.predict([some_digit])\narray([5], dtype=uint8)\nThis time Scikit-Learn did not have to run OvA or OvO because Random Forest\nclassifiers can directly classify instances into multiple classes. You can call\npredict_proba() to get the list of probabilities that the classifier assigned to each\ninstance for each class:\n>>> forest_clf.predict_proba([some_digit])\narray([[0.  , 0.  , 0.01, 0.08, 0.  , 0.9 , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.01]])\nYou can see that the classifier is fairly confident about its prediction: the 0.9 at the 5th\nindex in the array means that the model estimates a 90% probability that the image\nrepresents a 5. It also thinks that the image could instead be a 2, a 3 or a 9, respec\u2010\ntively with 1%, 8% and 1% probability.\nNow of course you want to evaluate these classifiers. As usual, you want to use cross-\nvalidation. Let\u2019s evaluate the SGDClassifier\u2019s accuracy using the cross_val_score()\nfunction:\n>>> cross_val_score(sgd_clf, X_train, y_train, cv=3, scoring=\"accuracy\")\narray([0.8489802 , 0.87129356, 0.86988048])\nIt gets over 84% on all test folds. If you used a random classifier, you would get 10%\naccuracy, so this is not such a bad score, but you can still do much better. For exam\u2010\nple, simply scaling the inputs (as discussed in Chapter 2) increases accuracy above\n89%:\n>>> from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n>>> scaler = StandardScaler()\n>>> X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train.astype(np.float64))\n>>> cross_val_score(sgd_clf, X_train_scaled, y_train, cv=3, scoring=\"accuracy\")\narray([0.89707059, 0.8960948 , 0.90693604])",

It\u2019s often more convenient to look at an image representation\nof the confusion matrix, using Matplotlib\u2019s matshow() function:\nplt.matshow(conf_mx, cmap=plt.cm.gray)\nplt.show()\nThis confusion matrix looks fairly good, since most images are on the main diagonal,\nwhich means that they were classified correctly. The 5s look slightly darker than the\nother digits, which could mean that there are fewer images of 5s in the dataset or that\nthe classifier does not perform as well on 5s as on other digits. In fact, you can verify\nthat both are the case.\nLet\u2019s focus the plot on the errors. First, you need to divide each value in the confusion\nmatrix by the number of images in the corresponding class, so you can compare error\nError Analysis\n|\nrates instead of absolute number of errors (which would make abundant classes look\nunfairly bad):\nrow_sums = conf_mx.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)\nnorm_conf_mx = conf_mx / row_sums\nNow let\u2019s fill the diagonal with zeros to keep only the errors, and let\u2019s plot the result:\nnp.fill_diagonal(norm_conf_mx, 0)\nplt.matshow(norm_conf_mx, cmap=plt.cm.gray)\nplt.show()\nNow you can clearly see the kinds of errors the classifier makes. Remember that rows\nrepresent actual classes, while columns represent predicted classes. The column for\nclass 8 is quite bright, which tells you that many images get misclassified as 8s. How\u2010\never, the row for class 8 is not that bad, telling you that actual 8s in general get prop\u2010\nerly classified as 8s. As you can see, the confusion matrix is not necessarily\nsymmetrical. You can also see that 3s and 5s often get confused (in both directions).\nAnalyzing the confusion matrix can often give you insights on ways to improve your\nclassifier. Looking at this plot, it seems that your efforts should be spent on reducing\nthe false 8s. For example, you could try to gather more training data for digits that\nlook like 8s (but are not) so the classifier can learn to distinguish them from real 8s.\nOr you could engineer new features that would help the classifier\u2014for example, writ\u2010\ning an algorithm to count the number of closed loops (e.g., 8 has two, 6 has one, 5 has\nnone). Or you could preprocess the images (e.g., using Scikit-Image, Pillow, or\nOpenCV) to make some patterns stand out more, such as closed loops.\nAnalyzing individual errors can also be a good way to gain insights on what your\nclassifier is doing and why it is failing, but it is more difficult and time-consuming.\n|\nChapter 3: Classification\n3 But remember that our brain is a fantastic pattern recognition system, and our visual system does a lot of\ncomplex preprocessing before any information reaches our consciousness, so the fact that it feels simple does\nnot mean that it is.\nFor example, let\u2019s plot examples of 3s and 5s (the plot_digits() function just uses\nMatplotlib\u2019s imshow() function; see this chapter\u2019s Jupyter notebook for details):\ncl_a, cl_b = 3, 5\nX_aa = X_train[(y_train == cl_a) & (y_train_pred == cl_a)]\nX_ab = X_train[(y_train == cl_a) & (y_train_pred == cl_b)]\nX_ba = X_train[(y_train == cl_b) & (y_train_pred == cl_a)]\nX_bb = X_train[(y_train == cl_b) & (y_train_pred == cl_b)]\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,8))\nplt.subplot(221); plot_digits(X_aa[:25], images_per_row=5)\nplt.subplot(222); plot_digits(X_ab[:25], images_per_row=5)\nplt.subplot(223); plot_digits(X_ba[:25], images_per_row=5)\nplt.subplot(224); plot_digits(X_bb[:25], images_per_row=5)\nplt.show()\nThe two 5\u00d75 blocks on the left show digits classified as 3s, and the two 5\u00d75 blocks on\nthe right show images classified as 5s. Some of the digits that the classifier gets wrong\n(i.e., in the bottom-left and top-right blocks) are so badly written that even a human\nwould have trouble classifying them (e.g., the 5 on the 1st row and 2nd column truly\nlooks like a badly written 3). However, most misclassified images seem like obvious\nerrors to us, and it\u2019s hard to understand why the classifier made the mistakes it did.3\nThe reason is that we used a simple SGDClassifier, which is a linear model. All it\ndoes is assign a weight per class to each pixel, and when it sees a new image it just\nsums up the weighted pixel intensities to get a score for each class. So since 3s and 5s\ndiffer only by a few pixels, this model will easily confuse them.\nError Analysis\n|\nThe main difference between 3s and 5s is the position of the small line that joins the\ntop line to the bottom arc. If you draw a 3 with the junction slightly shifted to the left,\nthe classifier might classify it as a 5, and vice versa. In other words, this classifier is\nquite sensitive to image shifting and rotation. So one way to reduce the 3/5 confusion\nwould be to preprocess the images to ensure that they are well centered and not too\nrotated. This will probably help reduce other errors as well.",

In some cases you\nmay want your classifier to output multiple classes for each instance. For example,\nconsider a face-recognition classifier: what should it do if it recognizes several people\non the same picture? Of course it should attach one tag per person it recognizes. Say\nthe classifier has been trained to recognize three faces, Alice, Bob, and Charlie; then\nwhen it is shown a picture of Alice and Charlie, it should output [1, 0, 1] (meaning\n\u201c\nAlice yes, Bob no, Charlie yes\u201d). Such a classification system that outputs multiple\nbinary tags is called a multilabel classification system.\nWe won\u2019t go into face recognition just yet, but let\u2019s look at a simpler example, just for\nillustration purposes:\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\ny_train_large = (y_train >= 7)\ny_train_odd = (y_train % 2 == 1)\ny_multilabel = np.c_[y_train_large, y_train_odd]\nknn_clf = KNeighborsClassifier()\nknn_clf.fit(X_train, y_multilabel)\nThis code creates a y_multilabel array containing two target labels for each digit\nimage: the first indicates whether or not the digit is large (7, 8, or 9) and the second\nindicates whether or not it is odd. The next lines create a KNeighborsClassifier\ninstance (which supports multilabel classification, but not all classifiers do) and we\ntrain it using the multiple targets array. Now you can make a prediction, and notice\nthat it outputs two labels:\n>>> knn_clf.predict([some_digit])\narray([[False,  True]])\nAnd it gets it right! The digit 5 is indeed not large (False) and odd (True).\nThere are many ways to evaluate a multilabel classifier, and selecting the right metric\nreally depends on your project. For example, one approach is to measure the F1 score\nfor each individual label (or any other binary classifier metric discussed earlier), then\nsimply compute the average score. This code computes the average F1 score across all\nlabels:\n|\nChapter 3: Classification\n4 Scikit-Learn offers a few other averaging options and multilabel classifier metrics; see the documentation for\nmore details.\n>>> y_train_knn_pred = cross_val_predict(knn_clf, X_train, y_multilabel, cv=3)\n>>> f1_score(y_multilabel, y_train_knn_pred, average=\"macro\")\n0.976410265560605\nThis assumes that all labels are equally important, which may not be the case. In par\u2010\nticular, if you have many more pictures of Alice than of Bob or Charlie, you may want\nto give more weight to the classifier\u2019s score on pictures of Alice. One simple option is\nto give each label a weight equal to its support (i.e., the number of instances with that\ntarget label). To do this, simply set average=\"weighted\" in the preceding code.4",

It is simply a generaliza\u2010\ntion of multilabel classification where each label can be multiclass (i.e., it can have\nmore than two possible values).\nTo illustrate this, let\u2019s build a system that removes noise from images. It will take as\ninput a noisy digit image, and it will (hopefully) output a clean digit image, repre\u2010\nsented as an array of pixel intensities, just like the MNIST images. Notice that the\nclassifier\u2019s output is multilabel (one label per pixel) and each label can have multiple\nvalues (pixel intensity ranges from 0 to 255). It is thus an example of a multioutput\nclassification system.\nThe line between classification and regression is sometimes blurry,\nsuch as in this example. Arguably, predicting pixel intensity is more\nakin to regression than to classification. Moreover, multioutput\nsystems are not limited to classification tasks; you could even have\na system that outputs multiple labels per instance, including both\nclass labels and value labels.\nLet\u2019s start by creating the training and test sets by taking the MNIST images and\nadding noise to their pixel intensities using NumPy\u2019s randint() function. The target\nimages will be the original images:\nnoise = np.random.randint(0, 100, (len(X_train), 784))\nX_train_mod = X_train + noise\nnoise = np.random.randint(0, 100, (len(X_test), 784))\nX_test_mod = X_test + noise\ny_train_mod = X_train\ny_test_mod = X_test\nMultioutput Classification\n|\n5 You can use the shift() function from the scipy.ndimage.interpolation module. For example,\nshift(image, [2, 1], cval=0) shifts the image 2 pixels down and 1 pixel to the right.\nLet\u2019s take a peek at an image from the test set (yes, we\u2019re snooping on the test data, so\nyou should be frowning right now):\nOn the left is the noisy input image, and on the right is the clean target image. Now\nlet\u2019s train the classifier and make it clean this image:\nknn_clf.fit(X_train_mod, y_train_mod)\nclean_digit = knn_clf.predict([X_test_mod[some_index]])\nplot_digit(clean_digit)\nLooks close enough to the target! This concludes our tour of classification. Hopefully\nyou should now know how to select good metrics for classification tasks, pick the\nappropriate precision/recall tradeoff, compare classifiers, and more generally build\ngood classification systems for a variety of tasks.",

Linear Regression model prediction\ny = \u03b80 + \u03b81x1 + \u03b82x2 + \u22ef+ \u03b8nxn\n\u2022 \u0177 is the predicted value.\n|\nChapter 4: Training Models\n\u2022 n is the number of features.\n\u2022 xi is the ith feature value.\n\u2022 \u03b8j is the jth model parameter (including the bias term \u03b80 and the feature weights\n\u03b81, \u03b82, \u22ef, \u03b8n).\nThis can be written much more concisely using a vectorized form, as shown in Equa\u2010\ntion 4-2.\nEquation 4-2. Linear Regression model prediction (vectorized form)\ny = h\u03b8 x = \u03b8 \u00b7 x\n\u2022 \u03b8 is the model\u2019s parameter vector, containing the bias term \u03b80 and the feature\nweights \u03b81 to \u03b8n.\n\u2022 x is the instance\u2019s feature vector, containing x0 to xn, with x0 always equal to 1.\n\u2022 \u03b8 \u00b7 x is the dot product of the vectors \u03b8 and x, which is of course equal to\n\u03b80x0 + \u03b81x1 + \u03b82x2 + \u22ef+ \u03b8nxn.\n\u2022 h\u03b8 is the hypothesis function, using the model parameters \u03b8.\nIn Machine Learning, vectors are often represented as column vec\u2010\ntors, which are 2D arrays with a single column. If \u03b8 and x are col\u2010\numn vectors, then the prediction is: y = \u03b8Tx, where \u03b8T is the\ntranspose of \u03b8 (a row vector instead of a column vector) and \u03b8Tx is\nthe matrix multiplication of \u03b8T and x. It is of course the same pre\u2010\ndiction, except it is now represented as a single cell matrix rather\nthan a scalar value. In this book we will use this notation to avoid\nswitching between dot products and matrix multiplications.\nOkay, that\u2019s the Linear Regression model, so now how do we train it? Well, recall that\ntraining a model means setting its parameters so that the model best fits the training\nset. For this purpose, we first need a measure of how well (or poorly) the model fits\nthe training data. In Chapter 2 we saw that the most common performance measure\nof a regression model is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (Equation 2-1). There\u2010\nfore, to train a Linear Regression model, you need to find the value of \u03b8 that minimi\u2010\nzes the RMSE. In practice, it is simpler to minimize the Mean Square Error (MSE)\nLinear Regression\n|\n1 It is often the case that a learning algorithm will try to optimize a different function than the performance\nmeasure used to evaluate the final model. This is generally because that function is easier to compute, because\nit has useful differentiation properties that the performance measure lacks, or because we want to constrain\nthe model during training, as we will see when we discuss regularization.\n2 The demonstration that this returns the value of \u03b8 that minimizes the cost function is outside the scope of this\nbook.\nthan the RMSE, and it leads to the same result (because the value that minimizes a\nfunction also minimizes its square root).1\nThe MSE of a Linear Regression hypothesis h\u03b8 on a training set X is calculated using\nEquation 4-3.\nEquation 4-3. MSE cost function for a Linear Regression model\nMSE X, h\u03b8 = 1\nm \u2211\ni = 1\nm\n\u03b8Tx i \u2212y i 2\nMost of these notations were presented in Chapter 2 (see \u201cNotations\u201d on page 43).\nThe only difference is that we write h\u03b8 instead of just h in order to make it clear that\nthe model is parametrized by the vector \u03b8. To simplify notations, we will just write\nMSE(\u03b8) instead of MSE(X, h\u03b8).\nLinear Regression\n|\n3 Note that Scikit-Learn separates the bias term (intercept_) from the feature weights (coef_).\nplt.axis([0, 2, 0, 15])\nplt.show()\nFigure 4-2. Linear Regression model predictions\nPerforming linear regression using Scikit-Learn is quite simple:3\n>>> from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n>>> lin_reg = LinearRegression()\n>>> lin_reg.fit(X, y)\n>>> lin_reg.intercept_, lin_reg.coef_\n(array([4.21509616]), array([[2.77011339]]))\n>>> lin_reg.predict(X_new)\narray([[4.21509616],\n[9.75532293]])\nThe LinearRegression class is based on the scipy.linalg.lstsq() function (the\nname stands for \u201cleast squares\u201d), which you could call directly:\n>>> theta_best_svd, residuals, rank, s = np.linalg.lstsq(X_b, y, rcond=1e-6)\n>>> theta_best_svd\narray([[4.21509616],\n[2.77011339]])\nThis function computes \u03b8 = X+y, where  + is the pseudoinverse of X (specifically the\nMoore-Penrose inverse). You can use np.linalg.pinv() to compute the pseudoin\u2010\nverse directly:\n>>> np.linalg.pinv(X_b).dot(y)\narray([[4.21509616],\n[2.77011339]])\n|\nChapter 4: Training Models\nThe pseudoinverse itself is computed using a standard matrix factorization technique\ncalled Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) that can decompose the training set\nmatrix X into the matrix multiplication of three matrices U \u03a3 VT (see\nnumpy.linalg.svd()). The pseudoinverse is computed as X+ = V\u03a3+UT. To compute\nthe matrix \u03a3+, the algorithm takes \u03a3 and sets to zero all values smaller than a tiny\nthreshold value, then it replaces all the non-zero values with their inverse, and finally\nit transposes the resulting matrix. This approach is more efficient than computing the\nNormal Equation, plus it handles edge cases nicely: indeed, the Normal Equation may\nnot work if the matrix XTX is not invertible (i.e., singular), such as if m < n or if some\nfeatures are redundant, but the pseudoinverse is always defined.",

The general idea of Gradient Descent is to\ntweak parameters iteratively in order to minimize a cost function.\nGradient Descent\n|\nSuppose you are lost in the mountains in a dense fog; you can only feel the slope of\nthe ground below your feet. A good strategy to get to the bottom of the valley quickly\nis to go downhill in the direction of the steepest slope. This is exactly what Gradient\nDescent does: it measures the local gradient of the error function with regards to the\nparameter vector \u03b8, and it goes in the direction of descending gradient. Once the gra\u2010\ndient is zero, you have reached a minimum!\nConcretely, you start by filling \u03b8 with random values (this is called random initializa\u2010\ntion), and then you improve it gradually, taking one baby step at a time, each step\nattempting to decrease the cost function (e.g., the MSE), until the algorithm converges\nto a minimum (see Figure 4-3).\nFigure 4-3. Gradient Descent\nAn important parameter in Gradient Descent is the size of the steps, determined by\nthe learning rate hyperparameter. If the learning rate is too small, then the algorithm\nwill have to go through many iterations to converge, which will take a long time (see\nFigure 4-4).\n|\nChapter 4: Training Models\nFigure 4-4. Learning rate too small\nOn the other hand, if the learning rate is too high, you might jump across the valley\nand end up on the other side, possibly even higher up than you were before. This\nmight make the algorithm diverge, with larger and larger values, failing to find a good\nsolution (see Figure 4-5).\nFigure 4-5. Learning rate too large\nFinally, not all cost functions look like nice regular bowls. There may be holes, ridges,\nplateaus, and all sorts of irregular terrains, making convergence to the minimum very\ndifficult. Figure 4-6 shows the two main challenges with Gradient Descent: if the ran\u2010\ndom initialization starts the algorithm on the left, then it will converge to a local mini\u2010\nmum, which is not as good as the global minimum. If it starts on the right, then it will\ntake a very long time to cross the plateau, and if you stop too early you will never\nreach the global minimum.\nGradient Descent\n|\n4 Technically speaking, its derivative is Lipschitz continuous.\n5 Since feature 1 is smaller, it takes a larger change in \u03b81 to affect the cost function, which is why the bowl is\nelongated along the \u03b81 axis.\nFigure 4-6. Gradient Descent pitfalls\nFortunately, the MSE cost function for a Linear Regression model happens to be a\nconvex function, which means that if you pick any two points on the curve, the line\nsegment joining them never crosses the curve. This implies that there are no local\nminima, just one global minimum. It is also a continuous function with a slope that\nnever changes abruptly.4 These two facts have a great consequence: Gradient Descent\nis guaranteed to approach arbitrarily close the global minimum (if you wait long\nenough and if the learning rate is not too high).\nIn fact, the cost function has the shape of a bowl, but it can be an elongated bowl if\nthe features have very different scales. Figure 4-7 shows Gradient Descent on a train\u2010\ning set where features 1 and 2 have the same scale (on the left), and on a training set\nwhere feature 1 has much smaller values than feature 2 (on the right).5\nFigure 4-7. Gradient Descent with and without feature scaling\n|\nChapter 4: Training Models\nAs you can see, on the left the Gradient Descent algorithm goes straight toward the\nminimum, thereby reaching it quickly, whereas on the right it first goes in a direction\nalmost orthogonal to the direction of the global minimum, and it ends with a long\nmarch down an almost flat valley. It will eventually reach the minimum, but it will\ntake a long time.\nWhen using Gradient Descent, you should ensure that all features\nhave a similar scale (e.g., using Scikit-Learn\u2019s StandardScaler\nclass), or else it will take much longer to converge.\nThis diagram also illustrates the fact that training a model means searching for a\ncombination of model parameters that minimizes a cost function (over the training\nset). It is a search in the model\u2019s parameter space: the more parameters a model has,\nthe more dimensions this space has, and the harder the search is: searching for a nee\u2010\ndle in a 300-dimensional haystack is much trickier than in three dimensions. Fortu\u2010\nnately, since the cost function is convex in the case of Linear Regression, the needle is\nsimply at the bottom of the bowl.\nGradient Descent\n|\n6 Eta (\u03b7) is the 7th letter of the Greek alphabet.\nEquation 4-6. Gradient vector of the cost function\n\u2207\u03b8 MSE \u03b8 =\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b80\nMSE \u03b8\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b81\nMSE \u03b8\n\u22ee\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b8n\nMSE \u03b8\n= 2\nmXT X\u03b8 \u2212y\nNotice that this formula involves calculations over the full training\nset X, at each Gradient Descent step! This is why the algorithm is\ncalled Batch Gradient Descent: it uses the whole batch of training\ndata at every step (actually, Full Gradient Descent would probably\nbe a better name). As a result it is terribly slow on very large train\u2010\ning sets (but we will see much faster Gradient Descent algorithms\nshortly). However, Gradient Descent scales well with the number of\nfeatures; training a Linear Regression model when there are hun\u2010\ndreds of thousands of features is much faster using Gradient\nDescent than using the Normal Equation or SVD decomposition.\nOnce you have the gradient vector, which points uphill, just go in the opposite direc\u2010\ntion to go downhill. This means subtracting \u2207\u03b8MSE(\u03b8) from \u03b8. This is where the\nlearning rate \u03b7 comes into play:6 multiply the gradient vector by \u03b7 to determine the\nsize of the downhill step (Equation 4-7).\nEquation 4-7. Gradient Descent step\n\u03b8 next step = \u03b8 \u2212\u03b7\u2207\u03b8 MSE \u03b8\nLet\u2019s look at a quick implementation of this algorithm:\neta = 0.1  # learning rate\nn_iterations = 1000\nm = 100\ntheta = np.random.randn(2,1)  # random initialization\nfor iteration in range(n_iterations):\ngradients = 2/m * X_b.T.dot(X_b.dot(theta) - y)\ntheta = theta - eta * gradients\n|\nChapter 4: Training Models\nThat wasn\u2019t too hard! Let\u2019s look at the resulting theta:\n>>> theta\narray([[4.21509616],\n[2.77011339]])\nHey, that\u2019s exactly what the Normal Equation found! Gradient Descent worked per\u2010\nfectly. But what if you had used a different learning rate eta? Figure 4-8 shows the\nfirst 10 steps of Gradient Descent using three different learning rates (the dashed line\nrepresents the starting point).\nFigure 4-8. Gradient Descent with various learning rates\nOn the left, the learning rate is too low: the algorithm will eventually reach the solu\u2010\ntion, but it will take a long time. In the middle, the learning rate looks pretty good: in\njust a few iterations, it has already converged to the solution. On the right, the learn\u2010\ning rate is too high: the algorithm diverges, jumping all over the place and actually\ngetting further and further away from the solution at every step.\nTo find a good learning rate, you can use grid search (see Chapter 2). However, you\nmay want to limit the number of iterations so that grid search can eliminate models\nthat take too long to converge.\nYou may wonder how to set the number of iterations. If it is too low, you will still be\nfar away from the optimal solution when the algorithm stops, but if it is too high, you\nwill waste time while the model parameters do not change anymore. A simple solu\u2010\ntion is to set a very large number of iterations but to interrupt the algorithm when the\ngradient vector becomes tiny\u2014that is, when its norm becomes smaller than a tiny\nnumber \u03f5 (called the tolerance)\u2014because this happens when Gradient Descent has\n(almost) reached the minimum.\nGradient Descent\n|\n7 Out-of-core algorithms are discussed in Chapter 1.\nConvergence Rate\nWhen the cost function is convex and its slope does not change abruptly (as is the\ncase for the MSE cost function), Batch Gradient Descent with a fixed learning rate\nwill eventually converge to the optimal solution, but you may have to wait a while: it\ncan take O(1/\u03f5) iterations to reach the optimum within a range of \u03f5 depending on the\nshape of the cost function. If you divide the tolerance by 10 to have a more precise\nsolution, then the algorithm may have to run about 10 times longer.\nGradient Descent\n|\nFigure 4-10. Stochastic Gradient Descent first 20 steps\nNote that since instances are picked randomly, some instances may be picked several\ntimes per epoch while others may not be picked at all. If you want to be sure that the\nalgorithm goes through every instance at each epoch, another approach is to shuffle\nthe training set (making sure to shuffle the input features and the labels jointly), then\ngo through it instance by instance, then shuffle it again, and so on. However, this gen\u2010\nerally converges more slowly.\nWhen using Stochastic Gradient Descent, the training instances\nmust be independent and identically distributed (IID), to ensure\nthat the parameters get pulled towards the global optimum, on\naverage. A simple way to ensure this is to shuffle the instances dur\u2010\ning training (e.g., pick each instance randomly, or shuffle the train\u2010\ning set at the beginning of each epoch). If you do not do this, for\nexample if the instances are sorted by label, then SGD will start by\noptimizing for one label, then the next, and so on, and it will not\nsettle close to the global minimum.\nTo perform Linear Regression using SGD with Scikit-Learn, you can use the SGDRe\ngressor class, which defaults to optimizing the squared error cost function.

At the opposite extreme, Stochastic Gradient Descent just\npicks a random instance in the training set at every step and computes the gradients\nbased only on that single instance. Obviously this makes the algorithm much faster\nsince it has very little data to manipulate at every iteration. It also makes it possible to\ntrain on huge training sets, since only one instance needs to be in memory at each\niteration (SGD can be implemented as an out-of-core algorithm.7)\nOn the other hand, due to its stochastic (i.e., random) nature, this algorithm is much\nless regular than Batch Gradient Descent: instead of gently decreasing until it reaches\nthe minimum, the cost function will bounce up and down, decreasing only on aver\u2010\nage. Over time it will end up very close to the minimum, but once it gets there it will\ncontinue to bounce around, never settling down (see Figure 4-9). So once the algo\u2010\nrithm stops, the final parameter values are good, but not optimal.\nFigure 4-9. Stochastic Gradient Descent\n|\nChapter 4: Training Models\nWhen the cost function is very irregular (as in Figure 4-6), this can actually help the\nalgorithm jump out of local minima, so Stochastic Gradient Descent has a better\nchance of finding the global minimum than Batch Gradient Descent does.\nTherefore randomness is good to escape from local optima, but bad because it means\nthat the algorithm can never settle at the minimum. One solution to this dilemma is\nto gradually reduce the learning rate. The steps start out large (which helps make\nquick progress and escape local minima), then get smaller and smaller, allowing the\nalgorithm to settle at the global minimum. This process is akin to simulated anneal\u2010\ning, an algorithm inspired from the process of annealing in metallurgy where molten\nmetal is slowly cooled down. The function that determines the learning rate at each\niteration is called the learning schedule. If the learning rate is reduced too quickly, you\nmay get stuck in a local minimum, or even end up frozen halfway to the minimum. If\nthe learning rate is reduced too slowly, you may jump around the minimum for a\nlong time and end up with a suboptimal solution if you halt training too early.\nThis code implements Stochastic Gradient Descent using a simple learning schedule:\nn_epochs = 50\nt0, t1 = 5, 50  # learning schedule hyperparameters\ndef learning_schedule(t):\nreturn t0 / (t + t1)\ntheta = np.random.randn(2,1)  # random initialization\nfor epoch in range(n_epochs):\nfor i in range(m):\nrandom_index = np.random.randint(m)\nxi = X_b[random_index:random_index+1]\nyi = y[random_index:random_index+1]\ngradients = 2 * xi.T.dot(xi.dot(theta) - yi)\neta = learning_schedule(epoch * m + i)\ntheta = theta - eta * gradients\nBy convention we iterate by rounds of m iterations; each round is called an epoch.\nWhile the Batch Gradient Descent code iterated 1,000 times through the whole train\u2010\ning set, this code goes through the training set only 50 times and reaches a fairly good\nsolution:\n>>> theta\narray([[4.21076011],\n[2.74856079]])\nFigure 4-10 shows the first 20 steps of training (notice how irregular the steps are).",

It is quite simple to understand once you know Batch and Stochastic Gradi\u2010\nent Descent: at each step, instead of computing the gradients based on the full train\u2010\ning set (as in Batch GD) or based on just one instance (as in Stochastic GD), Mini-\nbatch GD computes the gradients on small random sets of instances called mini-\nbatches. The main advantage of Mini-batch GD over Stochastic GD is that you can\nget a performance boost from hardware optimization of matrix operations, especially\nwhen using GPUs.\nThe algorithm\u2019s progress in parameter space is less erratic than with SGD, especially\nwith fairly large mini-batches. As a result, Mini-batch GD will end up walking\naround a bit closer to the minimum than SGD. But, on the other hand, it may be\nharder for it to escape from local minima (in the case of problems that suffer from\nlocal minima, unlike Linear Regression as we saw earlier).

Surprisingly,\nyou can actually use a linear model to fit nonlinear data. A simple way to do this is to\nadd powers of each feature as new features, then train a linear model on this extended\nset of features. This technique is called Polynomial Regression.\nLet\u2019s look at an example. First, let\u2019s generate some nonlinear data, based on a simple\nquadratic equation9 (plus some noise; see Figure 4-12):\nm = 100\nX = 6 * np.random.rand(m, 1) - 3\ny = 0.5 * X**2 + X + 2 + np.random.randn(m, 1)\n|\nChapter 4: Training Models\nFigure 4-12. Generated nonlinear and noisy dataset\nClearly, a straight line will never fit this data properly. So let\u2019s use Scikit-Learn\u2019s Poly\nnomialFeatures class to transform our training data, adding the square (2nd-degree\npolynomial) of each feature in the training set as new features (in this case there is\njust one feature):\n>>> from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\n>>> poly_features = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, include_bias=False)\n>>> X_poly = poly_features.fit_transform(X)\n>>> X[0]\narray([-0.75275929])\n>>> X_poly[0]\narray([-0.75275929, 0.56664654])\nX_poly now contains the original feature of X plus the square of this feature. Now you\ncan fit a LinearRegression model to this extended training data (Figure 4-13):\n>>> lin_reg = LinearRegression()\n>>> lin_reg.fit(X_poly, y)\n>>> lin_reg.intercept_, lin_reg.coef_\n(array([1.78134581]), array([[0.93366893, 0.56456263]]))\nPolynomial Regression\n|\nFigure 4-13.

This is made possible by the fact that PolynomialFeatures also\nadds all combinations of features up to the given degree. For example, if there were\ntwo features a and b, PolynomialFeatures with degree=3 would not only add the\nfeatures a2, a3, b2, and b3, but also the combinations ab, a2b, and ab2.\nPolynomialFeatures(degree=d) transforms an array containing n\nfeatures into an array containing n + d !\nd! n!  features, where n! is the\nfactorial of n, equal to 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 \u22ef \u00d7 n.

For example, Figure 4-14 applies\na 300-degree polynomial model to the preceding training data, and compares the\nresult with a pure linear model and a quadratic model (2nd-degree polynomial).\nNotice how the 300-degree polynomial model wiggles around to get as close as possi\u2010\nble to the training instances.\n|\nChapter 4: Training Models\nFigure 4-14. High-degree Polynomial Regression\nOf course, this high-degree Polynomial Regression model is severely overfitting the\ntraining data, while the linear model is underfitting it. The model that will generalize\nbest in this case is the quadratic model. It makes sense since the data was generated\nusing a quadratic model, but in general you won\u2019t know what function generated the\ndata, so how can you decide how complex your model should be? How can you tell\nthat your model is overfitting or underfitting the data?\nIn Chapter 2 you used cross-validation to get an estimate of a model\u2019s generalization\nperformance. If a model performs well on the training data but generalizes poorly\naccording to the cross-validation metrics, then your model is overfitting. If it per\u2010\nforms poorly on both, then it is underfitting. This is one way to tell when a model is\ntoo simple or too complex.\nAnother way is to look at the learning curves: these are plots of the model\u2019s perfor\u2010\nmance on the training set and the validation set as a function of the training set size\n(or the training iteration). To generate the plots, simply train the model several times\non different sized subsets of the training set. The following code defines a function\nthat plots the learning curves of a model given some training data:\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\ndef plot_learning_curves(model, X, y):\nX_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)\ntrain_errors, val_errors = [], []\nfor m in range(1, len(X_train)):\nmodel.fit(X_train[:m], y_train[:m])\ny_train_predict = model.predict(X_train[:m])\nLearning Curves\n|\ny_val_predict = model.predict(X_val)\ntrain_errors.append(mean_squared_error(y_train[:m], y_train_predict))\nval_errors.append(mean_squared_error(y_val, y_val_predict))\nplt.plot(np.sqrt(train_errors), \"r-+\", linewidth=2, label=\"train\")\nplt.plot(np.sqrt(val_errors), \"b-\", linewidth=3, label=\"val\")\nLet\u2019s look at the learning curves of the plain Linear Regression model (a straight line;\nFigure 4-15):\nlin_reg = LinearRegression()\nplot_learning_curves(lin_reg, X, y)\nFigure 4-15. Learning curves\nThis deserves a bit of explanation. First, let\u2019s look at the performance on the training\ndata: when there are just one or two instances in the training set, the model can fit\nthem perfectly, which is why the curve starts at zero. But as new instances are added\nto the training set, it becomes impossible for the model to fit the training data per\u2010\nfectly, both because the data is noisy and because it is not linear at all. So the error on\nthe training data goes up until it reaches a plateau, at which point adding new instan\u2010\nces to the training set doesn\u2019t make the average error much better or worse. Now let\u2019s\nlook at the performance of the model on the validation data. When the model is\ntrained on very few training instances, it is incapable of generalizing properly, which\nis why the validation error is initially quite big. Then as the model is shown more\ntraining examples, it learns and thus the validation error slowly goes down. However,\nonce again a straight line cannot do a good job modeling the data, so the error ends\nup at a plateau, very close to the other curve.\nThese learning curves are typical of an underfitting model. Both curves have reached\na plateau; they are close and fairly high.\n|\nChapter 4: Training Models\nIf your model is underfitting the training data, adding more train\u2010\ning examples will not help. You need to use a more complex model\nor come up with better features.\nNow let\u2019s look at the learning curves of a 10th-degree polynomial model on the same\ndata (Figure 4-16):\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\npolynomial_regression = Pipeline([\n(\"poly_features\", PolynomialFeatures(degree=10, include_bias=False)),\n(\"lin_reg\", LinearRegression()),\n])\nplot_learning_curves(polynomial_regression, X, y)\nThese learning curves look a bit like the previous ones, but there are two very impor\u2010\ntant differences:\n\u2022 The error on the training data is much lower than with the Linear Regression\nmodel.\n\u2022 There is a gap between the curves. This means that the model performs signifi\u2010\ncantly better on the training data than on the validation data, which is the hall\u2010\nmark of an overfitting model. However, if you used a much larger training set,\nthe two curves would continue to get closer.\nFigure 4-16. Learning curves for the polynomial model\nLearning Curves\n|\n10 This notion of bias is not to be confused with the bias term of linear models.\nOne way to improve an overfitting model is to feed it more training\ndata until the validation error reaches the training error.\nThe Bias/Variance Tradeoff\nAn important theoretical result of statistics and Machine Learning is the fact that a\nmodel\u2019s generalization error can be expressed as the sum of three very different\nerrors:\nBias\nThis part of the generalization error is due to wrong assumptions, such as assum\u2010\ning that the data is linear when it is actually quadratic. A high-bias model is most\nlikely to underfit the training data.10\nVariance\nThis part is due to the model\u2019s excessive sensitivity to small variations in the\ntraining data. A model with many degrees of freedom (such as a high-degree pol\u2010\nynomial model) is likely to have high variance, and thus to overfit the training\ndata.\nIrreducible error\nThis part is due to the noisiness of the data itself. The only way to reduce this\npart of the error is to clean up the data (e.g., fix the data sources, such as broken\nsensors, or detect and remove outliers).\nIncreasing a model\u2019s complexity will typically increase its variance and reduce its bias.\nConversely, reducing a model\u2019s complexity increases its bias and reduces its variance.\nThis is why it is called a tradeoff.",

For example, a simple way to regularize a polynomial model\nis to reduce the number of polynomial degrees.\nFor a linear model, regularization is typically achieved by constraining the weights of\nthe model. We will now look at Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net,\nwhich implement three different ways to constrain the weights.\n|\nChapter 4: Training Models\n11 It is common to use the notation J(\u03b8) for cost functions that don\u2019t have a short name; we will often use this\nnotation throughout the rest of this book. The context will make it clear which cost function is being dis\u2010\ncussed.\n12 Norms are discussed in Chapter 2.\nRegularized Linear Models\n|\n13 A square matrix full of 0s except for 1s on the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).\nFigure 4-17 shows several Ridge models trained on some linear data using different \u03b1\nvalue. On the left, plain Ridge models are used, leading to linear predictions. On the\nright, the data is first expanded using PolynomialFeatures(degree=10), then it is\nscaled using a StandardScaler, and finally the Ridge models are applied to the result\u2010\ning features: this is Polynomial Regression with Ridge regularization. Note how\nincreasing \u03b1 leads to flatter (i.e., less extreme, more reasonable) predictions; this\nreduces the model\u2019s variance but increases its bias.\nAs with Linear Regression, we can perform Ridge Regression either by computing a\nclosed-form equation or by performing Gradient Descent. The pros and cons are the\nsame. Equation 4-9 shows the closed-form solution (where A is the (n + 1) \u00d7 (n + 1)\nidentity matrix13 except with a 0 in the top-left cell, corresponding to the bias term).\nFigure 4-17.

Stochastic Average GD is a variant of SGD.\nFor more details, see the presentation \u201cMinimizing Finite Sums with the Stochastic Average Gradient Algo\u2010\nrithm\u201d by Mark Schmidt et al. from the University of British Columbia.\n>>> ridge_reg.predict([[1.5]])\narray([[1.55071465]])\nAnd using Stochastic Gradient Descent:14\n>>> sgd_reg = SGDRegressor(penalty=\"l2\")\n>>> sgd_reg.fit(X, y.ravel())\n>>> sgd_reg.predict([[1.5]])\narray([1.47012588])\nThe penalty hyperparameter sets the type of regularization term to use. Specifying\n\"l2\" indicates that you want SGD to add a regularization term to the cost function\nequal to half the square of the \u21132 norm of the weight vector: this is simply Ridge\nRegression.\nRegularized Linear Models\n|\nFigure 4-18. Lasso Regression\nAn important characteristic of Lasso Regression is that it tends to completely elimi\u2010\nnate the weights of the least important features (i.e., set them to zero). For example,\nthe dashed line in the right plot on Figure 4-18 (with \u03b1 = 10-7) looks quadratic, almost\nlinear: all the weights for the high-degree polynomial features are equal to zero. In\nother words, Lasso Regression automatically performs feature selection and outputs a\nsparse model (i.e., with few nonzero feature weights).\nYou can get a sense of why this is the case by looking at Figure 4-19: on the top-left\nplot, the background contours (ellipses) represent an unregularized MSE cost func\u2010\ntion (\u03b1 = 0), and the white circles show the Batch Gradient Descent path with that\ncost function. The foreground contours (diamonds) represent the \u21131 penalty, and the\ntriangles show the BGD path for this penalty only (\u03b1 \u2192 \u221e). Notice how the path first\nreaches \u03b81 = 0, then rolls down a gutter until it reaches \u03b82 = 0. On the top-right plot,\nthe contours represent the same cost function plus an \u21131 penalty with \u03b1 = 0.5. The\nglobal minimum is on the \u03b82 = 0 axis. BGD first reaches \u03b82 = 0, then rolls down the\ngutter until it reaches the global minimum. The two bottom plots show the same\nthing but uses an \u21132 penalty instead. The regularized minimum is closer to \u03b8 = 0 than\nthe unregularized minimum, but the weights do not get fully eliminated.\n|\nChapter 4: Training Models\n15 You can think of a subgradient vector at a nondifferentiable point as an intermediate vector between the gra\u2010\ndient vectors around that point.\nFigure 4-19. Lasso versus Ridge regularization\nOn the Lasso cost function, the BGD path tends to bounce across\nthe gutter toward the end. This is because the slope changes\nabruptly at \u03b82 = 0. You need to gradually reduce the learning rate in\norder to actually converge to the global minimum.\nThe Lasso cost function is not differentiable at \u03b8i = 0 (for i = 1, 2, \u22ef, n), but Gradient\nDescent still works fine if you use a subgradient vector g15 instead when any \u03b8i = 0.\nEquation 4-11 shows a subgradient vector equation you can use for Gradient Descent\nwith the Lasso cost function.\nEquation 4-11.

Note that the regularization term should only be added\nto the cost function during training. Once the model is trained, you want to evaluate\nthe model\u2019s performance using the unregularized performance measure.\nIt is quite common for the cost function used during training to be\ndifferent from the performance measure used for testing. Apart\nfrom regularization, another reason why they might be different is\nthat a good training cost function should have optimization-\nfriendly derivatives, while the performance measure used for test\u2010\ning should be as close as possible to the final objective. A good\nexample of this is a classifier trained using a cost function such as\nthe log loss (discussed in a moment) but evaluated using precision/\nrecall.\nThe hyperparameter \u03b1 controls how much you want to regularize the model.

Logistic Regression (also called Logit Regression) is com\u2010\nmonly used to estimate the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class\n(e.g., what is the probability that this email is spam?). If the estimated probability is\ngreater than 50%, then the model predicts that the instance belongs to that class\n(called the positive class, labeled \u201c1\u201d), or else it predicts that it does not (i.e., it\nbelongs to the negative class, labeled \u201c0\u201d). This makes it a binary classifier.\nLogistic Regression\n|\nThis cost function makes sense because \u2013 log(t) grows very large when t approaches\n0, so the cost will be large if the model estimates a probability close to 0 for a positive\ninstance, and it will also be very large if the model estimates a probability close to 1\nfor a negative instance. On the other hand, \u2013 log(t) is close to 0 when t is close to 1, so\nthe cost will be close to 0 if the estimated probability is close to 0 for a negative\ninstance or close to 1 for a positive instance, which is precisely what we want.\nThe cost function over the whole training set is simply the average cost over all train\u2010\ning instances. It can be written in a single expression (as you can verify easily), called\nthe log loss, shown in Equation 4-17.\nEquation 4-17. Logistic Regression cost function (log loss)\nJ \u03b8 = \u22121\nm \u2211i = 1\nm\ny i log p i\n+ 1 \u2212y i log 1 \u2212p i\nThe bad news is that there is no known closed-form equation to compute the value of\n\u03b8 that minimizes this cost function (there is no equivalent of the Normal Equation).\nBut the good news is that this cost function is convex, so Gradient Descent (or any\nother optimization algorithm) is guaranteed to find the global minimum (if the learn\u2010\ning rate is not too large and you wait long enough). The partial derivatives of the cost\nfunction with regards to the jth model parameter \u03b8j is given by Equation 4-18.\nEquation 4-18. Logistic cost function partial derivatives\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b8j\nJ \u03b8 = 1\nm \u2211\ni = 1\nm\n\u03c3 \u03b8Tx i\n\u2212y i xj\ni\nThis equation looks very much like Equation 4-5: for each instance it computes the\nprediction error and multiplies it by the jth feature value, and then it computes the\naverage over all training instances. Once you have the gradient vector containing all\nthe partial derivatives you can use it in the Batch Gradient Descent algorithm. That\u2019s\nit: you now know how to train a Logistic Regression model. For Stochastic GD you\nwould of course just take one instance at a time, and for Mini-batch GD you would\nuse a mini-batch at a time.\nLogistic Regression\n|\n18 It is the the set of points x such that \u03b80 + \u03b81x1 + \u03b82x2 = 0, which defines a straight line.\nplt.plot(X_new, y_proba[:, 0], \"b--\", label=\"Not Iris-Virginica\")\n# + more Matplotlib code to make the image look pretty\nFigure 4-23. Estimated probabilities and decision boundary\nThe petal width of Iris-Virginica flowers (represented by triangles) ranges from 1.4\ncm to 2.5 cm, while the other iris flowers (represented by squares) generally have a\nsmaller petal width, ranging from 0.1 cm to 1.8 cm. Notice that there is a bit of over\u2010\nlap. Above about 2 cm the classifier is highly confident that the flower is an Iris-\nVirginica (it outputs a high probability to that class), while below 1 cm it is highly\nconfident that it is not an Iris-Virginica (high probability for the \u201cNot Iris-Virginica\u201d\nclass). In between these extremes, the classifier is unsure. However, if you ask it to\npredict the class (using the predict() method rather than the predict_proba()\nmethod), it will return whichever class is the most likely. Therefore, there is a decision\nboundary at around 1.6 cm where both probabilities are equal to 50%: if the petal\nwidth is higher than 1.6 cm, the classifier will predict that the flower is an Iris-\nVirginica, or else it will predict that it is not (even if it is not very confident):\n>>> log_reg.predict([[1.7], [1.5]])\narray([1, 0])\nFigure 4-24 shows the same dataset but this time displaying two features: petal width\nand length. Once trained, the Logistic Regression classifier can estimate the probabil\u2010\nity that a new flower is an Iris-Virginica based on these two features. The dashed line\nrepresents the points where the model estimates a 50% probability: this is the model\u2019s\ndecision boundary. Note that it is a linear boundary.18 Each parallel line represents the\npoints where the model outputs a specific probability, from 15% (bottom left) to 90%\n(top right). All the flowers beyond the top-right line have an over 90% chance of\nbeing Iris-Virginica according to the model.\n|\nChapter 4: Training Models\nFigure 4-24. Linear decision boundary\nJust like the other linear models, Logistic Regression models can be regularized using\n\u21131 or \u21132 penalties. Scitkit-Learn actually adds an \u21132 penalty by default.\nThe hyperparameter controlling the regularization strength of a\nScikit-Learn LogisticRegression model is not alpha (as in other\nlinear models), but its inverse: C. The higher the value of C, the less\nthe model is regularized.\nLogistic Regression\n|\nthen normalizes them (dividing by the sum of all the exponentials). The scores are\ngenerally called logits or log-odds (although they are actually unnormalized log-\nodds).\nEquation 4-20.

Softmax Regression classifier prediction\ny = argmax\nk\n\u03c3 s x\nk = argmax\nk\nsk x = argmax\nk\n\u03b8 k Tx\n\u2022 The argmax operator returns the value of a variable that maximizes a function. In\nthis equation, it returns the value of k that maximizes the estimated probability\n\u03c3(s(x))k.\nThe Softmax Regression classifier predicts only one class at a time\n(i.e., it is multiclass, not multioutput) so it should be used only with\nmutually exclusive classes such as different types of plants. You\ncannot use it to recognize multiple people in one picture.\nNow that you know how the model estimates probabilities and makes predictions,\nlet\u2019s take a look at training. The objective is to have a model that estimates a high\nprobability for the target class (and consequently a low probability for the other\nclasses). Minimizing the cost function shown in Equation 4-22, called the cross\nentropy, should lead to this objective because it penalizes the model when it estimates\na low probability for a target class. Cross entropy is frequently used to measure how\n|\nChapter 4: Training Models\nwell a set of estimated class probabilities match the target classes (we will use it again\nseveral times in the following chapters).\nEquation 4-22. Cross entropy cost function\nJ \u0398 = \u22121\nm \u2211i = 1\nm\n\u2211k = 1\nK\nyk\ni log pk\ni\n\u2022 yk\ni  is the target probability that the ith instance belongs to class k. In general, it is\neither equal to 1 or 0, depending on whether the instance belongs to the class or\nnot.\nNotice that when there are just two classes (K = 2), this cost function is equivalent to\nthe Logistic Regression\u2019s cost function (log loss; see Equation 4-17).\nCross Entropy\nCross entropy originated from information theory. Suppose you want to efficiently\ntransmit information about the weather every day. If there are eight options (sunny,\nrainy, etc.), you could encode each option using 3 bits since 23 = 8. However, if you\nthink it will be sunny almost every day, it would be much more efficient to code\n\u201csunny\u201d on just one bit (0) and the other seven options on 4 bits (starting with a 1).\nCross entropy measures the average number of bits you actually send per option. If\nyour assumption about the weather is perfect, cross entropy will just be equal to the\nentropy of the weather itself (i.e., its intrinsic unpredictability). But if your assump\u2010\ntions are wrong (e.g., if it rains often), cross entropy will be greater by an amount\ncalled the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence.\nThe cross entropy between two probability distributions p and q is defined as\nH p, q = \u2212\u2211x p x log q x  (at least when the distributions are discrete). For more\ndetails, check out this video.\nThe gradient vector of this cost function with regards to \u03b8(k) is given by Equation\n4-23:\nEquation 4-23. Cross entropy gradient vector for class k\n\u2207\n\u03b8 k J \u0398 = 1\nm \u2211\ni = 1\nm\npk\ni \u2212yk\ni x i\nNow you can compute the gradient vector for every class, then use Gradient Descent\n(or any other optimization algorithm) to find the parameter matrix \u0398 that minimizes\nthe cost function.\nLogistic Regression\n|\nLet\u2019s use Softmax Regression to classify the iris flowers into all three classes. Scikit-\nLearn\u2019s LogisticRegression uses one-versus-all by default when you train it on more\nthan two classes, but you can set the multi_class hyperparameter to \"multinomial\"\nto switch it to Softmax Regression instead. You must also specify a solver that sup\u2010\nports Softmax Regression, such as the \"lbfgs\" solver (see Scikit-Learn\u2019s documenta\u2010\ntion for more details). It also applies \u21132 regularization by default, which you can\ncontrol using the hyperparameter C.\nX = iris[\"data\"][:, (2, 3)]  # petal length, petal width\ny = iris[\"target\"]\nsoftmax_reg = LogisticRegression(multi_class=\"multinomial\",solver=\"lbfgs\", C=10)\nsoftmax_reg.fit(X, y)\nSo the next time you find an iris with 5 cm long and 2 cm wide petals, you can ask\nyour model to tell you what type of iris it is, and it will answer Iris-Virginica (class 2)\nwith 94.2% probability (or Iris-Versicolor with 5.8% probability):\n>>> softmax_reg.predict([[5, 2]])\narray([2])\n>>> softmax_reg.predict_proba([[5, 2]])\narray([[6.38014896e-07, 5.74929995e-02, 9.42506362e-01]])\nFigure 4-25 shows the resulting decision boundaries, represented by the background\ncolors. Notice that the decision boundaries between any two classes are linear. The\nfigure also shows the probabilities for the Iris-Versicolor class, represented by the\ncurved lines (e.g., the line labeled with 0.450 represents the 45% probability bound\u2010\nary). Notice that the model can predict a class that has an estimated probability below\n50%. For example, at the point where all decision boundaries meet, all classes have an\nequal estimated probability of 33%.\nFigure 4-25.

Figure 5-1\nshows part of the iris dataset that was introduced at the end of Chapter 4. The two\nclasses can clearly be separated easily with a straight line (they are linearly separable).\nThe left plot shows the decision boundaries of three possible linear classifiers. The\nmodel whose decision boundary is represented by the dashed line is so bad that it\ndoes not even separate the classes properly. The other two models work perfectly on\nthis training set, but their decision boundaries come so close to the instances that\nthese models will probably not perform as well on new instances. In contrast, the\nsolid line in the plot on the right represents the decision boundary of an SVM classi\u2010\nfier; this line not only separates the two classes but also stays as far away from the\nclosest training instances as possible. You can think of an SVM classifier as fitting the\nwidest possible street (represented by the parallel dashed lines) between the classes.\nThis is called large margin classification.\nFigure 5-1. Large margin classification\nNotice that adding more training instances \u201coff the street\u201d will not affect the decision\nboundary at all: it is fully determined (or \u201csupported\u201d) by the instances located on the\nedge of the street. These instances are called the support vectors (they are circled in\nFigure 5-1).\nSVMs are sensitive to the feature scales, as you can see in\nFigure 5-2: on the left plot, the vertical scale is much larger than the\nhorizontal scale, so the widest possible street is close to horizontal.\nAfter feature scaling (e.g., using Scikit-Learn\u2019s StandardScaler),\nthe decision boundary looks much better (on the right plot).\nFigure 5-2.

Another\noption is to use the SGDClassifier class, with SGDClassifier(loss=\"hinge\",\nalpha=1/(m*C)). This applies regular Stochastic Gradient Descent (see Chapter 4) to\ntrain a linear SVM classifier. It does not converge as fast as the LinearSVC class, but it\ncan be useful to handle huge datasets that do not fit in memory (out-of-core train\u2010\ning), or to handle online classification tasks.\nThe LinearSVC class regularizes the bias term, so you should center\nthe training set first by subtracting its mean.

There are two main issues with hard margin classifi\u2010\ncation. First, it only works if the data is linearly separable, and second it is quite sensi\u2010\ntive to outliers. Figure 5-3 shows the iris dataset with just one additional outlier: on\nthe left, it is impossible to find a hard margin, and on the right the decision boundary\nends up very different from the one we saw in Figure 5-1 without the outlier, and it\nwill probably not generalize as well.\n|\nChapter 5: Support Vector Machines\nFigure 5-3. Hard margin sensitivity to outliers\nTo avoid these issues it is preferable to use a more flexible model. The objective is to\nfind a good balance between keeping the street as large as possible and limiting the\nmargin violations (i.e., instances that end up in the middle of the street or even on the\nwrong side). This is called soft margin classification.\nIn Scikit-Learn\u2019s SVM classes, you can control this balance using the C hyperparame\u2010\nter: a smaller C value leads to a wider street but more margin violations. Figure 5-4\nshows the decision boundaries and margins of two soft margin SVM classifiers on a\nnonlinearly separable dataset. On the left, using a low C value the margin is quite\nlarge, but many instances end up on the street. On the right, using a high C value the\nclassifier makes fewer margin violations but ends up with a smaller margin. However,\nit seems likely that the first classifier will generalize better: in fact even on this train\u2010\ning set it makes fewer prediction errors, since most of the margin violations are\nactually on the correct side of the decision boundary.\nFigure 5-4. Large margin (left) versus fewer margin violations (right)\nIf your SVM model is overfitting, you can try regularizing it by\nreducing C.\nThe following Scikit-Learn code loads the iris dataset, scales the features, and then\ntrains a linear SVM model (using the LinearSVC class with C = 1 and the hinge loss\nfunction, described shortly) to detect Iris-Virginica flowers.

The simplest approach is to create a\nlandmark at the location of each and every instance in the dataset. This creates many\ndimensions and thus increases the chances that the transformed training set will be\nlinearly separable. The downside is that a training set with m instances and n features\ngets transformed into a training set with m instances and m features (assuming you\ndrop the original features).

This is controlled by\nthe tolerance hyperparameter \u03f5 (called tol in Scikit-Learn). In most classification\ntasks, the default tolerance is fine.\nThe SVC class is based on the libsvm library, which implements an algorithm that sup\u2010\nports the kernel trick.2 The training time complexity is usually between O(m2 \u00d7 n)\nand O(m3 \u00d7 n).

The resulting vector p will contain\nthe bias term b = p0 and the feature weights wi = pi for i = 1, 2, \u22ef, n. Similarly, you\ncan use a QP solver to solve the soft margin problem (see the exercises at the end of\nthe chapter).\nHowever, to use the kernel trick we are going to look at a different constrained opti\u2010\nmization problem.\nUnder the Hood\n|\nEquation 5-9. Kernel trick for a 2nd-degree polynomial mapping\n\u03d5 a T\u03d5 b\n=\na1\n2 a1a2\na2\nT\nb1\n2 b1b2\nb2\n= a1\n2b1\n2 + 2a1b1a2b2 + a2\n2b2\n= a1b1 + a2b2\n2 =\na1\na2\nT b1\nb2\n= aTb\nHow about that? The dot product of the transformed vectors is equal to the square of\nthe dot product of the original vectors: \u03d5(a)T \u03d5(b) = (aT b)2.\nNow here is the key insight: if you apply the transformation \u03d5 to all training instan\u2010\nces, then the dual problem (see Equation 5-6) will contain the dot product \u03d5(x(i))T\n\u03d5(x(j)). But if \u03d5 is the 2nd-degree polynomial transformation defined in Equation 5-8,\nthen you can replace this dot product of transformed vectors simply by x i Tx j\n. So\nyou don\u2019t actually need to transform the training instances at all: just replace the dot\nproduct by its square in Equation 5-6. The result will be strictly the same as if you\nwent through the trouble of actually transforming the training set then fitting a linear\nSVM algorithm, but this trick makes the whole process much more computationally\nefficient. This is the essence of the kernel trick.\nThe function K(a, b) = (aT b)2 is called a 2nd-degree polynomial kernel. In Machine\nLearning, a kernel is a function capable of computing the dot product \u03d5(a)T \u03d5(b)\nbased only on the original vectors a and b, without having to compute (or even to\nknow about) the transformation \u03d5. Equation 5-10 lists some of the most commonly\nused kernels.\nEquation 5-10. Common kernels\nLinear:\nK a, b = aTb\nPolynomial:\nK a, b = \u03b3aTb + r\nd\nGaussian RBF:\nK a, b = exp \u2212\u03b3\u2225a \u2212b \u22252\nSigmoid:\nK a, b = tanh \u03b3aTb + r\n|\nChapter 5: Support Vector Machines\nMercer\u2019s Theorem\nAccording to Mercer\u2019s theorem, if a function K(a, b) respects a few mathematical con\u2010\nditions called Mercer\u2019s conditions (K must be continuous, symmetric in its arguments\nso K(a, b) = K(b, a), etc.), then there exists a function \u03d5 that maps a and b into\nanother space (possibly with much higher dimensions) such that K(a, b) = \u03d5(a)T \u03d5(b).\nSo you can use K as a kernel since you know \u03d5 exists, even if you don\u2019t know what \u03d5\nis. In the case of the Gaussian RBF kernel, it can be shown that \u03d5 actually maps each\ntraining instance to an infinite-dimensional space, so it\u2019s a good thing you don\u2019t need\nto actually perform the mapping!\nNote that some frequently used kernels (such as the Sigmoid kernel) don\u2019t respect all\nof Mercer\u2019s conditions, yet they generally work well in practice.\nThere is still one loose end we must tie. Equation 5-7 shows how to go from the dual\nsolution to the primal solution in the case of a linear SVM classifier, but if you apply\nthe kernel trick you end up with equations that include \u03d5(x(i)). In fact, w must have\nthe same number of dimensions as \u03d5(x(i)), which may be huge or even infinite, so you\ncan\u2019t compute it. But how can you make predictions without knowing w? Well, the\ngood news is that you can plug in the formula for w from Equation 5-7 into the deci\u2010\nsion function for a new instance x(n), and you get an equation with only dot products\nbetween input vectors. This makes it possible to use the kernel trick, once again\n(Equation 5-11).\nEquation 5-11.

Of course, you also need to compute the bias term b, using the\nsame trick (Equation 5-12).\nUnder the Hood\n|\nEquation 5-12.

You start at the root node (depth 0, at the\ntop): this node asks whether the flower\u2019s petal length is smaller than 2.45 cm. If it is,\nthen you move down to the root\u2019s left child node (depth 1, left). In this case, it is a leaf\nnode (i.e., it does not have any children nodes), so it does not ask any questions: you\ncan simply look at the predicted class for that node and the Decision Tree predicts\nthat your flower is an Iris-Setosa (class=setosa).\nNow suppose you find another flower, but this time the petal length is greater than\n2.45 cm. You must move down to the root\u2019s right child node (depth 1, right), which is\nnot a leaf node, so it asks another question: is the petal width smaller than 1.75 cm? If\nit is, then your flower is most likely an Iris-Versicolor (depth 2, left). If not, it is likely\nan Iris-Virginica (depth 2, right). It\u2019s really that simple.\nOne of the many qualities of Decision Trees is that they require\nvery little data preparation. In particular, they don\u2019t require feature\nscaling or centering at all.\nMaking Predictions\n|\nA node\u2019s samples attribute counts how many training instances it applies to. For\nexample, 100 training instances have a petal length greater than 2.45 cm (depth 1,\nright), among which 54 have a petal width smaller than 1.75 cm (depth 2, left). A\nnode\u2019s value attribute tells you how many training instances of each class this node\napplies to: for example, the bottom-right node applies to 0 Iris-Setosa, 1 Iris-\nVersicolor, and 45 Iris-Virginica. Finally, a node\u2019s gini attribute measures its impur\u2010\nity: a node is \u201cpure\u201d (gini=0) if all training instances it applies to belong to the same\nclass. For example, since the depth-1 left node applies only to Iris-Setosa training\ninstances, it is pure and its gini score is 0. Equation 6-1 shows how the training algo\u2010\nrithm computes the gini score Gi of the ith node. For example, the depth-2 left node\nhas a gini score equal to 1 \u2013 (0/54)2 \u2013 (49/54)2 \u2013 (5/54)2 \u2248 0.168. Another impurity\nmeasure is discussed shortly.\nEquation 6-1. Gini impurity\nGi = 1 \u2212\u2211\nk = 1\nn\npi, k\n\u2022 pi,k is the ratio of class k instances among the training instances in the ith node.\nScikit-Learn uses the CART algorithm, which produces only binary\ntrees: nonleaf nodes always have two children (i.e., questions only\nhave yes/no answers). However, other algorithms such as ID3 can\nproduce Decision Trees with nodes that have more than two chil\u2010\ndren.\nFigure 6-2 shows this Decision Tree\u2019s decision boundaries. The thick vertical line rep\u2010\nresents the decision boundary of the root node (depth 0): petal length = 2.45 cm.\nSince the left area is pure (only Iris-Setosa), it cannot be split any further. However,\nthe right area is impure, so the depth-1 right node splits it at petal width = 1.75 cm\n(represented by the dashed line). Since max_depth was set to 2, the Decision Tree\nstops right there.

Such models are often called white box models. In contrast, as we will see, Ran\u2010\ndom Forests or neural networks are generally considered black box models. They\nmake great predictions, and you can easily check the calculations that they performed\nto make these predictions; nevertheless, it is usually hard to explain in simple terms\nwhy the predictions were made. For example, if a neural network says that a particu\u2010\nlar person appears on a picture, it is hard to know what actually contributed to this\nprediction: did the model recognize that person\u2019s eyes? Her mouth? Her nose? Her\nshoes? Or even the couch that she was sitting on? Conversely, Decision Trees provide\nnice and simple classification rules that can even be applied manually if need be (e.g.,\nfor flower classification).",

If left\nunconstrained, the tree structure will adapt itself to the training data, fitting it very\nclosely, and most likely overfitting it. Such a model is often called a nonparametric\nmodel, not because it does not have any parameters (it often has a lot) but because the\nnumber of parameters is not determined prior to training, so the model structure is\nfree to stick closely to the data. In contrast, a parametric model such as a linear model\nhas a predetermined number of parameters, so its degree of freedom is limited,\nreducing the risk of overfitting (but increasing the risk of underfitting).\nTo avoid overfitting the training data, you need to restrict the Decision Tree\u2019s freedom\nduring training. As you know by now, this is called regularization. The regularization\nhyperparameters depend on the algorithm used, but generally you can at least restrict\nthe maximum depth of the Decision Tree. In Scikit-Learn, this is controlled by the\nmax_depth hyperparameter (the default value is None, which means unlimited).\nReducing max_depth will regularize the model and thus reduce the risk of overfitting.\nThe DecisionTreeClassifier class has a few other parameters that similarly restrict\nthe shape of the Decision Tree: min_samples_split (the minimum number of sam\u2010\nples a node must have before it can be split), min_samples_leaf (the minimum num\u2010\nber of samples a leaf node must have), min_weight_fraction_leaf (same as\nmin_samples_leaf but expressed as a fraction of the total number of weighted\n|\nChapter 6: Decision Trees\ninstances), max_leaf_nodes (maximum number of leaf nodes), and max_features\n(maximum number of features that are evaluated for splitting at each node). Increas\u2010\ning min_* hyperparameters or reducing max_* hyperparameters will regularize the\nmodel.\nOther algorithms work by first training the Decision Tree without\nrestrictions, then pruning (deleting) unnecessary nodes. A node\nwhose children are all leaf nodes is considered unnecessary if the\npurity improvement it provides is not statistically significant. Stan\u2010\ndard statistical tests, such as the \u03c72 test, are used to estimate the\nprobability that the improvement is purely the result of chance\n(which is called the null hypothesis). If this probability, called the p-\nvalue, is higher than a given threshold (typically 5%, controlled by\na hyperparameter), then the node is considered unnecessary and its\nchildren are deleted. The pruning continues until all unnecessary\nnodes have been pruned.\nFigure 6-3 shows two Decision Trees trained on the moons dataset (introduced in\nChapter 5). On the left, the Decision Tree is trained with the default hyperparameters\n(i.e., no restrictions), and on the right the Decision Tree is trained with min_sam\nples_leaf=4.

Training diverse classifiers\nA very simple way to create an even better classifier is to aggregate the predictions of\neach classifier and predict the class that gets the most votes. This majority-vote classi\u2010\nfier is called a hard voting classifier (see Figure 7-2).\nFigure 7-2. Hard voting classifier predictions\n|\nChapter 7: Ensemble Learning and Random Forests\nSomewhat surprisingly, this voting classifier often achieves a higher accuracy than the\nbest classifier in the ensemble. In fact, even if each classifier is a weak learner (mean\u2010\ning it does only slightly better than random guessing), the ensemble can still be a\nstrong learner (achieving high accuracy), provided there are a sufficient number of\nweak learners and they are sufficiently diverse.\nHow is this possible? The following analogy can help shed some light on this mystery.\nSuppose you have a slightly biased coin that has a 51% chance of coming up heads,\nand 49% chance of coming up tails. If you toss it 1,000 times, you will generally get\nmore or less 510 heads and 490 tails, and hence a majority of heads. If you do the\nmath, you will find that the probability of obtaining a majority of heads after 1,000\ntosses is close to 75%. The more you toss the coin, the higher the probability (e.g.,\nwith 10,000 tosses, the probability climbs over 97%). This is due to the law of large\nnumbers: as you keep tossing the coin, the ratio of heads gets closer and closer to the\nprobability of heads (51%). Figure 7-3 shows 10 series of biased coin tosses. You can\nsee that as the number of tosses increases, the ratio of heads approaches 51%. Eventu\u2010\nally all 10 series end up so close to 51% that they are consistently above 50%.\nFigure 7-3. The law of large numbers\nSimilarly, suppose you build an ensemble containing 1,000 classifiers that are individ\u2010\nually correct only 51% of the time (barely better than random guessing). If you pre\u2010\ndict the majority voted class, you can hope for up to 75% accuracy! However, this is\nonly true if all classifiers are perfectly independent, making uncorrelated errors,\nwhich is clearly not the case since they are trained on the same data. They are likely to\nmake the same types of errors, so there will be many majority votes for the wrong\nclass, reducing the ensemble\u2019s accuracy.\nVoting Classifiers\n|\nEnsemble methods work best when the predictors are as independ\u2010\nent from one another as possible. One way to get diverse classifiers\nis to train them using very different algorithms. This increases the\nchance that they will make very different types of errors, improving\nthe ensemble\u2019s accuracy.\nThe following code creates and trains a voting classifier in Scikit-Learn, composed of\nthree diverse classifiers (the training set is the moons dataset, introduced in Chap\u2010\nter 5):\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nlog_clf = LogisticRegression()\nrnd_clf = RandomForestClassifier()\nsvm_clf = SVC()\nvoting_clf = VotingClassifier(\nestimators=[('lr', log_clf), ('rf', rnd_clf), ('svc', svm_clf)],\nvoting='hard')\nvoting_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\nLet\u2019s look at each classifier\u2019s accuracy on the test set:\n>>> from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n>>> for clf in (log_clf, rnd_clf, svm_clf, voting_clf):\n...     clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n...     y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)\n...     print(clf.__class__.__name__, accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))\n...\nLogisticRegression 0.864\nRandomForestClassifier 0.896\nSVC 0.888\nVotingClassifier 0.904\nThere you have it! The voting classifier slightly outperforms all the individual classifi\u2010\ners.\nIf all classifiers are able to estimate class probabilities (i.e., they have a pre\ndict_proba() method), then you can tell Scikit-Learn to predict the class with the\nhighest class probability, averaged over all the individual classifiers. This is called soft\nvoting. It often achieves higher performance than hard voting because it gives more\nweight to highly confident votes. All you need to do is replace voting=\"hard\" with\nvoting=\"soft\" and ensure that all classifiers can estimate class probabilities. This is\nnot the case of the SVC class by default, so you need to set its probability hyperpara\u2010\nmeter to True (this will make the SVC class use cross-validation to estimate class prob\u2010\nabilities, slowing down training, and it will add a predict_proba() method).

Each individual\nBagging and Pasting\n|\n4 Bias and variance were introduced in Chapter 4.\n5 max_samples can alternatively be set to a float between 0.0 and 1.0, in which case the max number of instances\nto sample is equal to the size of the training set times max_samples.\npredictor has a higher bias than if it were trained on the original training set, but\naggregation reduces both bias and variance.4 Generally, the net result is that the\nensemble has a similar bias but a lower variance than a single predictor trained on the\noriginal training set.\nAs you can see in Figure 7-4, predictors can all be trained in parallel, via different\nCPU cores or even different servers. Similarly, predictions can be made in parallel.\nThis is one of the reasons why bagging and pasting are such popular methods: they\nscale very well.\nBagging and Pasting\n|\n7 \u201cEnsembles on Random Patches,\u201d G.

There are many boosting methods available, but by far the most popular are\nBoosting\n|\n13 \u201cA Decision-Theoretic Generalization of On-Line Learning and an Application to Boosting,\u201d Yoav Freund,\nRobert E.

SVMs are generally not good base predictors for AdaBoost, because they\nare slow and tend to be unstable with AdaBoost.\nAdaBoost13 (short for Adaptive Boosting) and Gradient Boosting. Let\u2019s start with Ada\u2010\nBoost.\nBoosting\n|\n15 The original AdaBoost algorithm does not use a learning rate hyperparameter.\nThe predictor\u2019s weight \u03b1j is then computed using Equation 7-2, where \u03b7 is the learn\u2010\ning rate hyperparameter (defaults to 1).15 The more accurate the predictor is, the\nhigher its weight will be. If it is just guessing randomly, then its weight will be close to\nzero. However, if it is most often wrong (i.e., less accurate than random guessing),\nthen its weight will be negative.\nEquation 7-2. Predictor weight\n\u03b1j = \u03b7 log\n1 \u2212rj\nrj\nNext the instance weights are updated using Equation 7-3: the misclassified instances\nare boosted.\nEquation 7-3.

The algorithm stops when the desired\nnumber of predictors is reached, or when a perfect predictor is found.\nTo make predictions, AdaBoost simply computes the predictions of all the predictors\nand weighs them using the predictor weights \u03b1j.

Friedman (1999).\nScikit-Learn actually uses a multiclass version of AdaBoost called SAMME16 (which\nstands for Stagewise Additive Modeling using a Multiclass Exponential loss function).\nWhen there are just two classes, SAMME is equivalent to AdaBoost. Moreover, if the\npredictors can estimate class probabilities (i.e., if they have a predict_proba()\nmethod), Scikit-Learn can use a variant of SAMME called SAMME.R (the R stands\nfor \u201cReal\u201d), which relies on class probabilities rather than predictions and generally\nperforms better.\nThe following code trains an AdaBoost classifier based on 200 Decision Stumps using\nScikit-Learn\u2019s AdaBoostClassifier class (as you might expect, there is also an Ada\nBoostRegressor class). A Decision Stump is a Decision Tree with max_depth=1\u2014in\nother words, a tree composed of a single decision node plus two leaf nodes. This is\nthe default base estimator for the AdaBoostClassifier class:\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier\nada_clf = AdaBoostClassifier(\nDecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1), n_estimators=200,\nalgorithm=\"SAMME.R\", learning_rate=0.5)\nada_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\nIf your AdaBoost ensemble is overfitting the training set, you can\ntry reducing the number of estimators or more strongly regulariz\u2010\ning the base estimator.\nBoosting\n|\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\ntree_reg1 = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=2)\ntree_reg1.fit(X, y)\nNow train a second DecisionTreeRegressor on the residual errors made by the first\npredictor:\ny2 = y - tree_reg1.predict(X)\ntree_reg2 = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=2)\ntree_reg2.fit(X, y2)\nThen we train a third regressor on the residual errors made by the second predictor:\ny3 = y2 - tree_reg2.predict(X)\ntree_reg3 = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=2)\ntree_reg3.fit(X, y3)\nNow we have an ensemble containing three trees. It can make predictions on a new\ninstance simply by adding up the predictions of all the trees:\ny_pred = sum(tree.predict(X_new) for tree in (tree_reg1, tree_reg2, tree_reg3))\nFigure 7-9 represents the predictions of these three trees in the left column, and the\nensemble\u2019s predictions in the right column. In the first row, the ensemble has just one\ntree, so its predictions are exactly the same as the first tree\u2019s predictions. In the second\nrow, a new tree is trained on the residual errors of the first tree. On the right you can\nsee that the ensemble\u2019s predictions are equal to the sum of the predictions of the first\ntwo trees. Similarly, in the third row another tree is trained on the residual errors of\nthe second tree. You can see that the ensemble\u2019s predictions gradually get better as\ntrees are added to the ensemble.\nA simpler way to train GBRT ensembles is to use Scikit-Learn\u2019s GradientBoostingRe\ngressor class. Much like the RandomForestRegressor class, it has hyperparameters to\ncontrol the growth of Decision Trees (e.g., max_depth, min_samples_leaf, and so on),\nas well as hyperparameters to control the ensemble training, such as the number of\ntrees (n_estimators). The following code creates the same ensemble as the previous\none:\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor\ngbrt = GradientBoostingRegressor(max_depth=2, n_estimators=3, learning_rate=1.0)\ngbrt.fit(X, y)\n|\nChapter 7: Ensemble Learning and Random Forests\nFigure 7-9. Gradient Boosting\nThe learning_rate hyperparameter scales the contribution of each tree. If you set it\nto a low value, such as 0.1, you will need more trees in the ensemble to fit the train\u2010\ning set, but the predictions will usually generalize better. This is a regularization tech\u2010\nnique called shrinkage. Figure 7-10 shows two GBRT ensembles trained with a low\nlearning rate: the one on the left does not have enough trees to fit the training set,\nwhile the one on the right has too many trees and overfits the training set.\nBoosting\n|\nFigure 7-10. GBRT ensembles with not enough predictors (left) and too many (right)\nIn order to find the optimal number of trees, you can use early stopping (see Chap\u2010\nter 4). A simple way to implement this is to use the staged_predict() method: it\nreturns an iterator over the predictions made by the ensemble at each stage of train\u2010\ning (with one tree, two trees, etc.). The following code trains a GBRT ensemble with\n120 trees, then measures the validation error at each stage of training to find the opti\u2010\nmal number of trees, and finally trains another GBRT ensemble using the optimal\nnumber of trees:\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nX_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y)\ngbrt = GradientBoostingRegressor(max_depth=2, n_estimators=120)\ngbrt.fit(X_train, y_train)\nerrors = [mean_squared_error(y_val, y_pred)\nfor y_pred in gbrt.staged_predict(X_val)]\nbst_n_estimators = np.argmin(errors)\ngbrt_best = GradientBoostingRegressor(max_depth=2,n_estimators=bst_n_estimators)\ngbrt_best.fit(X_train, y_train)\nThe validation errors are represented on the left of Figure 7-11, and the best model\u2019s\npredictions are represented on the right.\n|\nChapter 7: Ensemble Learning and Random Forests\nFigure 7-11. Tuning the number of trees using early stopping\nIt is also possible to implement early stopping by actually stopping training early\n(instead of training a large number of trees first and then looking back to find the\noptimal number). You can do so by setting warm_start=True, which makes Scikit-\nLearn keep existing trees when the fit() method is called, allowing incremental\ntraining. The following code stops training when the validation error does not\nimprove for five iterations in a row:\ngbrt = GradientBoostingRegressor(max_depth=2, warm_start=True)\nmin_val_error = float(\"inf\")\nerror_going_up = 0\nfor n_estimators in range(1, 120):\ngbrt.n_estimators = n_estimators\ngbrt.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_pred = gbrt.predict(X_val)\nval_error = mean_squared_error(y_val, y_pred)\nif val_error < min_val_error:\nmin_val_error = val_error\nerror_going_up = 0\nelse:\nerror_going_up += 1\nif error_going_up == 5:\nbreak  # early stopping\nThe GradientBoostingRegressor class also supports a subsample hyperparameter,\nwhich specifies the fraction of training instances to be used for training each tree. For\nexample, if subsample=0.25, then each tree is trained on 25% of the training instan\u2010\nces, selected randomly. As you can probably guess by now, this trades a higher bias\nfor a lower variance. It also speeds up training considerably. This technique is called\nStochastic Gradient Boosting.\nBoosting\n|\n18 \u201cStacked Generalization,\u201d D. Wolpert (1992).\nIt is possible to use Gradient Boosting with other cost functions.\nThis is controlled by the loss hyperparameter (see Scikit-Learn\u2019s\ndocumentation for more details).\nIt is worth noting that an optimized implementation of Gradient Boosting is available\nin the popular python library XGBoost, which stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting.\nThis package was initially developed by Tianqi Chen as part of the Distributed (Deep)\nMachine Learning Community (DMLC), and it aims at being extremely fast, scalable\nand portable. In fact, XGBoost is often an important component of the winning\nentries in ML competitions. XGBoost\u2019s API is quite similar to Scikit-Learn\u2019s:\nimport xgboost\nxgb_reg = xgboost.XGBRegressor()\nxgb_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_pred = xgb_reg.predict(X_val)\nXGBoost also offers several nice features, such as automatically taking care of early\nstopping:\nxgb_reg.fit(X_train, y_train,\neval_set=[(X_val, y_val)], early_stopping_rounds=2)\ny_pred = xgb_reg.predict(X_val)\nYou should definitely check it out!",

AdaBoost sequential training with instance weight updates\nFigure 7-8 shows the decision boundaries of five consecutive predictors on the\nmoons dataset (in this example, each predictor is a highly regularized SVM classifier\nwith an RBF kernel14).

The second classifier therefore does a better job on these instances, and\nso on. The plot on the right represents the same sequence of predictors except that\nthe learning rate is halved (i.e., the misclassified instance weights are boosted half as\nmuch at every iteration). As you can see, this sequential learning technique has some\nsimilarities with Gradient Descent, except that instead of tweaking a single predictor\u2019s\nparameters to minimize a cost function, AdaBoost adds predictors to the ensemble,\ngradually making it better.\nFigure 7-8. Decision boundaries of consecutive predictors\nOnce all predictors are trained, the ensemble makes predictions very much like bag\u2010\nging or pasting, except that predictors have different weights depending on their\noverall accuracy on the weighted training set.\nThere is one important drawback to this sequential learning techni\u2010\nque: it cannot be parallelized (or only partially), since each predic\u2010\ntor can only be trained after the previous predictor has been\ntrained and evaluated. As a result, it does not scale as well as bag\u2010\nging or pasting.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the AdaBoost algorithm. Each instance weight w(i) is initially\nset to 1\nm. A first predictor is trained and its weighted error rate r1 is computed on the\ntraining set; see Equation 7-1.\nEquation 7-1.

Figure 7-12 shows such an\nensemble performing a regression task on a new instance. Each of the bottom three\npredictors predicts a different value (3.1, 2.7, and 2.9), and then the final predictor\n(called a blender, or a meta learner) takes these predictions as inputs and makes the\nfinal prediction (3.0).\n|\nChapter 7: Ensemble Learning and Random Forests\n19 Alternatively, it is possible to use out-of-fold predictions. In some contexts this is called stacking, while using a\nhold-out set is called blending. However, for many people these terms are synonymous.\nFigure 7-12. Aggregating predictions using a blending predictor\nTo train the blender, a common approach is to use a hold-out set.19 Let\u2019s see how it\nworks. First, the training set is split in two subsets. The first subset is used to train the\npredictors in the first layer (see Figure 7-13).\nFigure 7-13. Training the first layer\nNext, the first layer predictors are used to make predictions on the second (held-out)\nset (see Figure 7-14). This ensures that the predictions are \u201cclean,\u201d since the predictors\nnever saw these instances during training. Now for each instance in the hold-out set\nStacking\n|\nthere are three predicted values. We can create a new training set using these predic\u2010\nted values as input features (which makes this new training set three-dimensional),\nand keeping the target values. The blender is trained on this new training set, so it\nlearns to predict the target value given the first layer\u2019s predictions.\nFigure 7-14. Training the blender\nIt is actually possible to train several different blenders this way (e.g., one using Lin\u2010\near Regression, another using Random Forest Regression, and so on): we get a whole\nlayer of blenders. The trick is to split the training set into three subsets: the first one is\nused to train the first layer, the second one is used to create the training set used to\ntrain the second layer (using predictions made by the predictors of the first layer),\nand the third one is used to create the training set to train the third layer (using pre\u2010\ndictions made by the predictors of the second layer). Once this is done, we can make\na prediction for a new instance by going through each layer sequentially, as shown in\nFigure 7-15.\n|\nChapter 7: Ensemble Learning and Random Forests\nFigure 7-15. Predictions in a multilayer stacking ensemble\nUnfortunately, Scikit-Learn does not support stacking directly, but it is not too hard\nto roll out your own implementation (see the following exercises).

Reproduced from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract.\n3 Fun fact: anyone you know is probably an extremist in at least one dimension (e.g., how much sugar they put\nin their coffee), if you consider enough dimensions.\nFigure 8-1. Point, segment, square, cube, and tesseract (0D to 4D hypercubes)2\nIt turns out that many things behave very differently in high-dimensional space. For\nexample, if you pick a random point in a unit square (a 1 \u00d7 1 square), it will have only\nabout a 0.4% chance of being located less than 0.001 from a border (in other words, it\nis very unlikely that a random point will be \u201cextreme\u201d along any dimension). But in a\n10,000-dimensional unit hypercube (a 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 \u22ef \u00d7 1 cube, with ten thousand 1s), this\nprobability is greater than 99.999999%. Most points in a high-dimensional hypercube\nare very close to the border.3\nHere is a more troublesome difference: if you pick two points randomly in a unit\nsquare, the distance between these two points will be, on average, roughly 0.52. If you\npick two random points in a unit 3D cube, the average distance will be roughly 0.66.\nBut what about two points picked randomly in a 1,000,000-dimensional hypercube?\nWell, the average distance, believe it or not, will be about 408.25 (roughly\n1, 000, 000/6)! This is quite counterintuitive: how can two points be so far apart\nwhen they both lie within the same unit hypercube? This fact implies that high-\ndimensional datasets are at risk of being very sparse: most training instances are\nlikely to be far away from each other. Of course, this also means that a new instance\nwill likely be far away from any training instance, making predictions much less relia\u2010\nble than in lower dimensions, since they will be based on much larger extrapolations.\nIn short, the more dimensions the training set has, the greater the risk of overfitting\nit.\nIn theory, one solution to the curse of dimensionality could be to increase the size of\nthe training set to reach a sufficient density of training instances. Unfortunately, in\npractice, the number of training instances required to reach a given density grows\nexponentially with the number of dimensions. With just 100 features (much less than\nThe Curse of Dimensionality\n|\nin the MNIST problem), you would need more training instances than atoms in the\nobservable universe in order for training instances to be within 0.1 of each other on\naverage, assuming they were spread out uniformly across all dimensions.",

Put simply, a 2D manifold is a 2D\nshape that can be bent and twisted in a higher-dimensional space. More generally, a\nd-dimensional manifold is a part of an n-dimensional space (where d < n) that locally\nresembles a d-dimensional hyperplane. In the case of the Swiss roll, d = 2 and n = 3: it\nlocally resembles a 2D plane, but it is rolled in the third dimension.\nMany dimensionality reduction algorithms work by modeling the manifold on which\nthe training instances lie; this is called Manifold Learning. It relies on the manifold\nassumption, also called the manifold hypothesis, which holds that most real-world\nhigh-dimensional datasets lie close to a much lower-dimensional manifold. This\nassumption is very often empirically observed.\nOnce again, think about the MNIST dataset: all handwritten digit images have some\nsimilarities. They are made of connected lines, the borders are white, they are more\nor less centered, and so on. If you randomly generated images, only a ridiculously\ntiny fraction of them would look like handwritten digits. In other words, the degrees\nof freedom available to you if you try to create a digit image are dramatically lower\nthan the degrees of freedom you would have if you were allowed to generate any\nimage you wanted. These constraints tend to squeeze the dataset into a lower-\ndimensional manifold.\nThe manifold assumption is often accompanied by another implicit assumption: that\nthe task at hand (e.g., classification or regression) will be simpler if expressed in the\nlower-dimensional space of the manifold. For example, in the top row of Figure 8-6\nthe Swiss roll is split into two classes: in the 3D space (on the left), the decision\n|\nChapter 8: Dimensionality Reduction\nboundary would be fairly complex, but in the 2D unrolled manifold space (on the\nright), the decision boundary is a simple straight line.\nHowever, this assumption does not always hold. For example, in the bottom row of\nFigure 8-6, the decision boundary is located at x1 = 5. This decision boundary looks\nvery simple in the original 3D space (a vertical plane), but it looks more complex in\nthe unrolled manifold (a collection of four independent line segments).\nIn short, if you reduce the dimensionality of your training set before training a\nmodel, it will usually speed up training, but it may not always lead to a better or sim\u2010\npler solution; it all depends on the dataset.\nHopefully you now have a good sense of what the curse of dimensionality is and how\ndimensionality reduction algorithms can fight it, especially when the manifold\nassumption holds. The rest of this chapter will go through some of the most popular\nalgorithms.\nFigure 8-6. The decision boundary may not always be simpler with lower dimensions",

This is called Kernel\n|\nChapter 8: Dimensionality Reduction\n6 \u201cKernel Principal Component Analysis,\u201d B. Sch\u00f6lkopf, A. Smola, K.

However, reconstruction is not\nas easy as with linear PCA. Here\u2019s why. Figure 8-11 shows the original Swiss roll 3D\ndataset (top left), and the resulting 2D dataset after kPCA is applied using an RBF\nkernel (top right). Thanks to the kernel trick, this is mathematically equivalent to\nmapping the training set to an infinite-dimensional feature space (bottom right)\nusing the feature map \u03c6, then projecting the transformed training set down to 2D\nusing linear PCA. Notice that if we could invert the linear PCA step for a given\ninstance in the reduced space, the reconstructed point would lie in feature space, not\nin the original space (e.g., like the one represented by an x in the diagram). Since the\nfeature space is infinite-dimensional, we cannot compute the reconstructed point,\nand therefore we cannot compute the true reconstruction error. Fortunately, it is pos\u2010\nsible to find a point in the original space that would map close to the reconstructed\npoint. This is called the reconstruction pre-image. Once you have this pre-image, you\ncan measure its squared distance to the original instance. You can then select the ker\u2010\nnel and hyperparameters that minimize this reconstruction pre-image error.\n|\nChapter 8: Dimensionality Reduction\n7 Scikit-Learn uses the algorithm based on Kernel Ridge Regression described in Gokhan H.

It is a Manifold Learning technique that does not rely\non projections like the previous algorithms. In a nutshell, LLE works by first measur\u2010\ning how each training instance linearly relates to its closest neighbors (c.n.), and then\nlooking for a low-dimensional representation of the training set where these local\nrelationships are best preserved (more details shortly). This makes it particularly\ngood at unrolling twisted manifolds, especially when there is not too much noise.\nFor example, the following code uses Scikit-Learn\u2019s LocallyLinearEmbedding class to\nunroll the Swiss roll. The resulting 2D dataset is shown in Figure 8-12. As you can\nsee, the Swiss roll is completely unrolled and the distances between instances are\nlocally well preserved. However, distances are not preserved on a larger scale: the left\npart of the unrolled Swiss roll is stretched, while the right part is squeezed. Neverthe\u2010\nless, LLE did a pretty good job at modeling the manifold.\nfrom sklearn.manifold import LocallyLinearEmbedding\nlle = LocallyLinearEmbedding(n_components=2, n_neighbors=10)\nX_reduced = lle.fit_transform(X)\n|\nChapter 8: Dimensionality Reduction\nFigure 8-12. Unrolled Swiss roll using LLE\nHere\u2019s how LLE works: first, for each training instance x(i), the algorithm identifies its\nk closest neighbors (in the preceding code k = 10), then tries to reconstruct x(i) as a\nlinear function of these neighbors. More specifically, it finds the weights wi,j such that\nthe squared distance between x(i) and \u2211j = 1\nm\nwi, jx j  is as small as possible, assuming wi,j\n= 0 if x(j) is not one of the k closest neighbors of x(i). Thus the first step of LLE is the\nconstrained optimization problem described in Equation 8-4, where W is the weight\nmatrix containing all the weights wi,j. The second constraint simply normalizes the\nweights for each training instance x(i).\nLLE\n|\nEquation 8-4.

Now the second step is to map the\ntraining instances into a d-dimensional space (where d < n) while preserving these\nlocal relationships as much as possible. If z(i) is the image of x(i) in this d-dimensional\nspace, then we want the squared distance between z(i) and \u2211j = 1\nm\nwi, jz j  to be as small\nas possible. This idea leads to the unconstrained optimization problem described in\nEquation 8-5. It looks very similar to the first step, but instead of keeping the instan\u2010\nces fixed and finding the optimal weights, we are doing the reverse: keeping the\nweights fixed and finding the optimal position of the instances\u2019 images in the low-\ndimensional space.

They are not perfectly identical,\nyet they are sufficiently similar for you to know that they most likely belong to the\nsame species (or at least the same genus). You may need a botanist to tell you what\nspecies that is, but you certainly don\u2019t need an expert to identify groups of similar-\nlooking objects. This is called clustering: it is the task of identifying similar instances\nand assigning them to clusters, i.e., groups of similar instances.\nJust like in classification, each instance gets assigned to a group. However, this is an\nunsupervised task. Consider Figure 9-1: on the left is the iris dataset (introduced in\nChapter 4), where each instance\u2019s species (i.e., its class) is represented with a different\nmarker. It is a labeled dataset, for which classification algorithms such as Logistic\nRegression, SVMs or Random Forest classifiers are well suited. On the right is the\nsame dataset, but without the labels, so you cannot use a classification algorithm any\u2010\nmore. This is where clustering algorithms step in: many of them can easily detect the\ntop left cluster. It is also quite easy to see with our own eyes, but it is not so obvious\nthat the lower right cluster is actually composed of two distinct sub-clusters. That\nsaid, the dataset actually has two additional features (sepal length and width), not\n|\nChapter 9: Unsupervised Learning Techniques\nrepresented here, and clustering algorithms can make good use of all features, so in\nfact they identify the three clusters fairly well (e.g., using a Gaussian mixture model,\nonly 5 instances out of 150 are assigned to the wrong cluster).\nFigure 9-1. Classification (left) versus clustering (right)\nClustering is used in a wide variety of applications, including:\n\u2022 For customer segmentation: you can cluster your customers based on their pur\u2010\nchases, their activity on your website, and so on. This is useful to understand who\nyour customers are and what they need, so you can adapt your products and\nmarketing campaigns to each segment. For example, this can be useful in recom\u2010\nmender systems to suggest content that other users in the same cluster enjoyed.\n\u2022 For data analysis: when analyzing a new dataset, it is often useful to first discover\nclusters of similar instances, as it is often easier to analyze clusters separately.\n\u2022 As a dimensionality reduction technique: once a dataset has been clustered, it is\nusually possible to measure each instance\u2019s affinity with each cluster (affinity is\nany measure of how well an instance fits into a cluster). Each instance\u2019s feature\nvector x can then be replaced with the vector of its cluster affinities. If there are k\nclusters, then this vector is k dimensional. This is typically much lower dimen\u2010\nsional than the original feature vector, but it can preserve enough information for\nfurther processing.\n\u2022 For anomaly detection (also called outlier detection): any instance that has a low\naffinity to all the clusters is likely to be an anomaly. For example, if you have clus\u2010\ntered the users of your website based on their behavior, you can detect users with\nunusual behavior, such as an unusual number of requests per second, and so on.\nAnomaly detection is particularly useful in detecting defects in manufacturing, or\nfor fraud detection.\n\u2022 For semi-supervised learning: if you only have a few labels, you could perform\nclustering and propagate the labels to all the instances in the same cluster. This\ncan greatly increase the amount of labels available for a subsequent supervised\nlearning algorithm, and thus improve its performance.\nClustering\n|\n1 \u201cLeast square quantization in PCM,\u201d Stuart P. Lloyd. (1982).\n\u2022 For search engines: for example, some search engines let you search for images\nthat are similar to a reference image. To build such a system, you would first\napply a clustering algorithm to all the images in your database: similar images\nwould end up in the same cluster. Then when a user provides a reference image,\nall you need to do is to find this image\u2019s cluster using the trained clustering\nmodel, and you can then simply return all the images from this cluster.\n\u2022 To segment an image: by clustering pixels according to their color, then replacing\neach pixel\u2019s color with the mean color of its cluster, it is possible to reduce the\nnumber of different colors in the image considerably. This technique is used in\nmany object detection and tracking systems, as it makes it easier to detect the\ncontour of each object.\nThere is no universal definition of what a cluster is: it really depends on the context,\nand different algorithms will capture different kinds of clusters. For example, some\nalgorithms look for instances centered around a particular point, called a centroid.\nOthers look for continuous regions of densely packed instances: these clusters can\ntake on any shape. Some algorithms are hierarchical, looking for clusters of clusters.\nAnd the list goes on.\nIn this section, we will look at two popular clustering algorithms: K-Means and\nDBSCAN, and we will show some of their applications, such as non-linear dimen\u2010\nsionality reduction, semi-supervised learning and anomaly detection.\nClustering\n|\n>>> X_new = np.array([[0, 2], [3, 2], [-3, 3], [-3, 2.5]])\n>>> kmeans.predict(X_new)\narray([1, 1, 2, 2], dtype=int32)\nIf you plot the cluster\u2019s decision boundaries, you get a Voronoi tessellation (see\nFigure 9-3, where each centroid is represented with an X):\nFigure 9-3. K-Means decision boundaries (Voronoi tessellation)\nThe vast majority of the instances were clearly assigned to the appropriate cluster, but\na few instances were probably mislabeled (especially near the boundary between the\ntop left cluster and the central cluster). Indeed, the K-Means algorithm does not\nbehave very well when the blobs have very different diameters since all it cares about\nwhen assigning an instance to a cluster is the distance to the centroid.\nInstead of assigning each instance to a single cluster, which is called hard clustering, it\ncan be useful to just give each instance a score per cluster: this is called soft clustering.\nFor example, the score can be the distance between the instance and the centroid, or\nconversely it can be a similarity score (or affinity) such as the Gaussian Radial Basis\nFunction (introduced in Chapter 5). In the KMeans class, the transform() method\nmeasures the distance from each instance to every centroid:\n>>> kmeans.transform(X_new)\narray([[2.81093633, 0.32995317, 2.9042344 , 1.49439034, 2.88633901],\n[5.80730058, 2.80290755, 5.84739223, 4.4759332 , 5.84236351],\n[1.21475352, 3.29399768, 0.29040966, 1.69136631, 1.71086031],\n[0.72581411, 3.21806371, 0.36159148, 1.54808703, 1.21567622]])\nIn this example, the first instance in X_new is located at a distance of 2.81 from the\nfirst centroid, 0.33 from the second centroid, 2.90 from the third centroid, 1.49 from\nthe fourth centroid and 2.87 from the fifth centroid. If you have a high-dimensional\ndataset and you transform it this way, you end up with a k-dimensional dataset: this\ncan be a very efficient non-linear dimensionality reduction technique.\n|\nChapter 9: Unsupervised Learning Techniques\n2 This can be proven by pointing out that the mean squared distance between the instances and their closest\ncentroid can only go down at each step.\nThe K-Means Algorithm\nSo how does the algorithm work? Well it is really quite simple. Suppose you were\ngiven the centroids: you could easily label all the instances in the dataset by assigning\neach of them to the cluster whose centroid is closest. Conversely, if you were given all\nthe instance labels, you could easily locate all the centroids by computing the mean of\nthe instances for each cluster. But you are given neither the labels nor the centroids,\nso how can you proceed? Well, just start by placing the centroids randomly (e.g., by\npicking k instances at random and using their locations as centroids). Then label the\ninstances, update the centroids, label the instances, update the centroids, and so on\nuntil the centroids stop moving. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge in a finite\nnumber of steps (usually quite small), it will not oscillate forever2. You can see the\nalgorithm in action in Figure 9-4: the centroids are initialized randomly (top left),\nthen the instances are labeled (top right), then the centroids are updated (center left),\nthe instances are relabeled (center right), and so on. As you can see, in just 3 itera\u2010\ntions the algorithm has reached a clustering that seems close to optimal.\nFigure 9-4. The K-Means algorithm\nClustering\n|\nThe computational complexity of the algorithm is generally linear\nwith regards to the number of instances m, the number of clusters\nk and the number of dimensions n. However, this is only true when\nthe data has a clustering structure. If it does not, then in the worst\ncase scenario the complexity can increase exponentially with the\nnumber of instances. In practice, however, this rarely happens, and\nK-Means is generally one of the fastest clustering algorithms.\nUnfortunately, although the algorithm is guaranteed to converge, it may not converge\nto the right solution (i.e., it may converge to a local optimum): this depends on the\ncentroid initialization. For example, Figure 9-5 shows two sub-optimal solutions that\nthe algorithm can converge to if you are not lucky with the random initialization step:\nFigure 9-5. Sub-optimal solutions due to unlucky centroid initializations\nLet\u2019s look at a few ways you can mitigate this risk by improving the centroid initializa\u2010\ntion.\nCentroid Initialization Methods\nIf you happen to know approximately where the centroids should be (e.g., if you ran\nanother clustering algorithm earlier), then you can set the init hyperparameter to a\nNumPy array containing the list of centroids, and set n_init to 1:\ngood_init = np.array([[-3, 3], [-3, 2], [-3, 1], [-1, 2], [0, 2]])\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5, init=good_init, n_init=1)\nAnother solution is to run the algorithm multiple times with different random initial\u2010\nizations and keep the best solution. This is controlled by the n_init hyperparameter:\nby default, it is equal to 10, which means that the whole algorithm described earlier\nactually runs 10 times when you call fit(), and Scikit-Learn keeps the best solution.\nBut how exactly does it know which solution is the best? Well of course it uses a per\u2010\nformance metric! It is called the model\u2019s inertia: this is the mean squared distance\nbetween each instance and its closest centroid. It is roughly equal to 223.3 for the\nmodel on the left of Figure 9-5, 237.5 for the model on the right of Figure 9-5, and\n211.6 for the model in Figure 9-3. The KMeans class runs the algorithm n_init times\nand keeps the model with the lowest inertia: in this example, the model in Figure 9-3\nwill be selected (unless we are very unlucky with n_init consecutive random initiali\u2010\n|\nChapter 9: Unsupervised Learning Techniques\n3 \u201ck-means\\++: The advantages of careful seeding,\u201d David Arthur and Sergei Vassilvitskii (2006).\n4 \u201cUsing the Triangle Inequality to Accelerate k-Means,\u201d Charles Elkan (2003).\nzations). If you are curious, a model\u2019s inertia is accessible via the inertia_ instance\nvariable:\n>>> kmeans.inertia_\n211.59853725816856\nThe score() method returns the negative inertia. Why negative? Well, it is because a\npredictor\u2019s score() method must always respect the \"great is better\" rule.\n>>> kmeans.score(X)\n-211.59853725816856\nAn important improvement to the K-Means algorithm, called K-Means+\\+, was pro\u2010\nposed in a 2006 paper by David Arthur and Sergei Vassilvitskii:3 they introduced a\nsmarter initialization step that tends to select centroids that are distant from one\nanother, and this makes the K-Means algorithm much less likely to converge to a sub-\noptimal solution. They showed that the additional computation required for the\nsmarter initialization step is well worth it since it makes it possible to drastically\nreduce the number of times the algorithm needs to be run to find the optimal solu\u2010\ntion. Here is the K-Means++ initialization algorithm:\n\u2022 Take one centroid c(1), chosen uniformly at random from the dataset.\n\u2022 Take a new centroid c(i), choosing an instance x(i) with probability: D  i\n\u2211j = 1\nm\nD  j 2 where D(x(i)) is the distance between the instance x(i) and the closest\ncentroid that was already chosen. This probability distribution ensures that\ninstances further away from already chosen centroids are much more likely be\nselected as centroids.\n\u2022 Repeat the previous step until all k centroids have been chosen.\nThe KMeans class actually uses this initialization method by default. If you want to\nforce it to use the original method (i.e., picking k instances randomly to define the\ninitial centroids), then you can set the init hyperparameter to \"random\". You will\nrarely need to do this.\nAccelerated K-Means and Mini-batch K-Means\nAnother important improvement to the K-Means algorithm was proposed in a 2003\npaper by Charles Elkan.4 It considerably accelerates the algorithm by avoiding many\nunnecessary distance calculations: this is achieved by exploiting the triangle inequal\u2010\nClustering\n|\n5 The triangle inequality is AC \u2264 AB + BC where A, B and C are three points, and AB, AC and BC are the\ndistances between these points.\n6 \u201cWeb-Scale K-Means Clustering,\u201d David Sculley (2010).\nity (i.e., the straight line is always the shortest5) and by keeping track of lower and\nupper bounds for distances between instances and centroids. This is the algorithm\nused by default by the KMeans class (but you can force it to use the original algorithm\nby setting the algorithm hyperparameter to \"full\", although you probably will\nnever need to).\nYet another important variant of the K-Means algorithm was proposed in a 2010\npaper by David Sculley.6 Instead of using the full dataset at each iteration, the algo\u2010\nrithm is capable of using mini-batches, moving the centroids just slightly at each iter\u2010\nation. This speeds up the algorithm typically by a factor of 3 or 4 and makes it\npossible to cluster huge datasets that do not fit in memory. Scikit-Learn implements\nthis algorithm in the MiniBatchKMeans class. You can just use this class like the\nKMeans class:\nfrom sklearn.cluster import MiniBatchKMeans\nminibatch_kmeans = MiniBatchKMeans(n_clusters=5)\nminibatch_kmeans.fit(X)\nIf the dataset does not fit in memory, the simplest option is to use the memmap class, as\nwe did for incremental PCA in Chapter 8. Alternatively, you can pass one mini-batch\nat a time to the partial_fit() method, but this will require much more work, since\nyou will need to perform multiple initializations and select the best one yourself (see\nthe notebook for an example).\nAlthough the Mini-batch K-Means algorithm is much faster than the regular K-\nMeans algorithm, its inertia is generally slightly worse, especially as the number of\nclusters increases. You can see this in Figure 9-6: the plot on the left compares the\ninertias of Mini-batch K-Means and regular K-Means models trained on the previous\ndataset using various numbers of clusters k. The difference between the two curves\nremains fairly constant, but this difference becomes more and more significant as k\nincreases, since the inertia becomes smaller and smaller. However, in the plot on the\nright, you can see that Mini-batch K-Means is much faster than regular K-Means, and\nthis difference increases with k.\n|\nChapter 9: Unsupervised Learning Techniques\nFigure 9-6. Mini-batch K-Means vs K-Means: worse inertia as k increases (left) but\nmuch faster (right)\nFinding the Optimal Number of Clusters\nSo far, we have set the number of clusters k to 5 because it was obvious by looking at\nthe data that this is the correct number of clusters. But in general, it will not be so\neasy to know how to set k, and the result might be quite bad if you set it to the wrong\nvalue. For example, as you can see in Figure 9-7, setting k to 3 or 8 results in fairly\nbad models:\nFigure 9-7. Bad choices for the number of clusters\nYou might be thinking that we could just pick the model with the lowest inertia,\nright? Unfortunately, it is not that simple. The inertia for k=3 is 653.2, which is much\nhigher than for k=5 (which was 211.6), but with k=8, the inertia is just 119.1. The\ninertia is not a good performance metric when trying to choose k since it keeps get\u2010\nting lower as we increase k. Indeed, the more clusters there are, the closer each\ninstance will be to its closest centroid, and therefore the lower the inertia will be. Let\u2019s\nplot the inertia as a function of k (see Figure 9-8):\nClustering\n|\nFigure 9-8. Selecting the number of clusters k using the \u201celbow rule\u201d\nAs you can see, the inertia drops very quickly as we increase k up to 4, but then it\ndecreases much more slowly as we keep increasing k. This curve has roughly the\nshape of an arm, and there is an \u201celbow\u201d at k=4 so if we did not know better, it would\nbe a good choice: any lower value would be dramatic, while any higher value would\nnot help much, and we might just be splitting perfectly good clusters in half for no\ngood reason.\nThis technique for choosing the best value for the number of clusters is rather coarse.\nA more precise approach (but also more computationally expensive) is to use the sil\u2010\nhouette score, which is the mean silhouette coefficient over all the instances. An instan\u2010\nce\u2019s silhouette coefficient is equal to (b \u2013 a) / max(a, b) where a is the mean distance\nto the other instances in the same cluster (it is the mean intra-cluster distance), and b\nis the mean nearest-cluster distance, that is the mean distance to the instances of the\nnext closest cluster (defined as the one that minimizes b, excluding the instance\u2019s own\ncluster). The silhouette coefficient can vary between -1 and +1: a coefficient close to\n+1 means that the instance is well inside its own cluster and far from other clusters,\nwhile a coefficient close to 0 means that it is close to a cluster boundary, and finally a\ncoefficient close to -1 means that the instance may have been assigned to the wrong\ncluster. To compute the silhouette score, you can use Scikit-Learn\u2019s silhou\nette_score() function, giving it all the instances in the dataset, and the labels they\nwere assigned:\n>>> from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score\n>>> silhouette_score(X, kmeans.labels_)\n0.655517642572828\nLet\u2019s compare the silhouette scores for different numbers of clusters (see Figure 9-9):\n|\nChapter 9: Unsupervised Learning Techniques\nFigure 9-9. Selecting the number of clusters k using the silhouette score\nAs you can see, this visualization is much richer than the previous one: in particular,\nalthough it confirms that k=4 is a very good choice, it also underlines the fact that\nk=5 is quite good as well, and much better than k=6 or 7. This was not visible when\ncomparing inertias.\nAn even more informative visualization is obtained when you plot every instance\u2019s\nsilhouette coefficient, sorted by the cluster they are assigned to and by the value of the\ncoefficient. This is called a silhouette diagram (see Figure 9-10):\nFigure 9-10. Silouhette analysis: comparing the silhouette diagrams for various values of\nk\nThe vertical dashed lines represent the silhouette score for each number of clusters.\nWhen most of the instances in a cluster have a lower coefficient than this score (i.e., if\nmany of the instances stop short of the dashed line, ending to the left of it), then the\ncluster is rather bad since this means its instances are much too close to other clus\u2010\nClustering\n|\nters. We can see that when k=3 and when k=6, we get bad clusters. But when k=4 or\nk=5, the clusters look pretty good \u2013 most instances extend beyond the dashed line, to\nthe right and closer to 1.0. When k=4, the cluster at index 1 (the third from the top),\nis rather big, while when k=5, all clusters have similar sizes, so even though the over\u2010\nall silhouette score from k=4 is slightly greater than for k=5, it seems like a good idea\nto use k=5 to get clusters of similar sizes.\nClustering\n|\ngets merged with colors from the environment. This is due to the fact that the lady\u2010\nbug is quite small, much smaller than the rest of the image, so even though its color is\nflashy, K-Means fails to dedicate a cluster to it: as mentioned earlier, K-Means prefers\nclusters of similar sizes.\nFigure 9-12. Image segmentation using K-Means with various numbers of color clusters\nThat was not too hard, was it? Now let\u2019s look at another application of clustering: pre\u2010\nprocessing.\nClustering\n|\nClustering\n|\n>>> np.mean(y_train_partially_propagated == y_train[partially_propagated])\n0.9896907216494846\nActive Learning\nTo continue improving your model and your training set, the next step could be to do\na few rounds of active learning: this is when a human expert interacts with the learn\u2010\ning algorithm, providing labels when the algorithm needs them. There are many dif\u2010\nferent strategies for active learning, but one of the most common ones is called\nuncertainty sampling:\n\u2022 The model is trained on the labeled instances gathered so far, and this model is\nused to make predictions on all the unlabeled instances.\n\u2022 The instances for which the model is most uncertain (i.e., when its estimated\nprobability is lowest) must be labeled by the expert.\n\u2022 Then you just iterate this process again and again, until the performance\nimprovement stops being worth the labeling effort.\nOther strategies include labeling the instances that would result in the largest model\nchange, or the largest drop in the model\u2019s validation error, or the instances that differ\u2010\nent models disagree on (e.g., an SVM, a Random Forest, and so on).\nBefore we move on to Gaussian mixture models, let\u2019s take a look at DBSCAN,\nanother popular clustering algorithm that illustrates a very different approach based\non local density estimation. This approach allows the algorithm to identify clusters of\narbitrary shapes.\nClustering\n|\nSomewhat surprisingly, the DBSCAN class does not have a predict() method,\nalthough it has a fit_predict() method. In other words, it cannot predict which\ncluster a new instance belongs to. The rationale for this decision is that several classi\u2010\nfication algorithms could make sense here, and it is easy enough to train one, for\nexample a KNeighborsClassifier:\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nknn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=50)\nknn.fit(dbscan.components_, dbscan.labels_[dbscan.core_sample_indices_])\nNow, given a few new instances, we can predict which cluster they most likely belong\nto, and even estimate a probability for each cluster. Note that we only trained them on\nthe core instances, but we could also have chosen to train them on all the instances,\nor all but the anomalies: this choice depends on the final task.\n>>> X_new = np.array([[-0.5, 0], [0, 0.5], [1, -0.1], [2, 1]])\n>>> knn.predict(X_new)\narray([1, 0, 1, 0])\n>>> knn.predict_proba(X_new)\narray([[0.18, 0.82],\n[1.  , 0.  ],\n[0.12, 0.88],\n[1.  , 0.  ]])\nThe decision boundary is represented on Figure 9-15 (the crosses represent the 4\ninstances in X_new). Notice that since there is no anomaly in the KNN\u2019s training set,\nthe classifier always chooses a cluster, even when that cluster is far away. However, it\nis fairly straightforward to introduce a maximum distance, in which case the two\ninstances that are far away from both clusters are classified as anomalies. To do this,\nwe can use the kneighbors() method of the KNeighborsClassifier: given a set of\ninstances, it returns the distances and the indices of the k nearest neighbors in the\ntraining set (two matrices, each with k columns):\n>>> y_dist, y_pred_idx = knn.kneighbors(X_new, n_neighbors=1)\n>>> y_pred = dbscan.labels_[dbscan.core_sample_indices_][y_pred_idx]\n>>> y_pred[y_dist > 0.2] = -1\n>>> y_pred.ravel()\narray([-1,  0,  1, -1])\n|\nChapter 9: Unsupervised Learning Techniques\nFigure 9-15. cluster_classification_diagram\nIn short, DBSCAN is a very simple yet powerful algorithm, capable of identifying any\nnumber of clusters, of any shape, it is robust to outliers, and it has just two hyper\u2010\nparameters (eps and min_samples). However, if the density varies significantly across\nthe clusters, it can be impossible for it to capture all the clusters properly. Moreover,\nits computational complexity is roughly O(m log m), making it pretty close to linear\nwith regards to the number of instances. However, Scikit-Learn\u2019s implementation can\nrequire up to O(m2) memory if eps is large.\nClustering\n|\njust enough information to quickly assign each new instance to a cluster, without\nhaving to store all the instances in the tree: this allows it to use limited memory,\nwhile handle huge datasets.\n\u2022 Mean-shift: this algorithm starts by placing a circle centered on each instance,\nthen for each circle it computes the mean of all the instances located within it,\nand it shifts the circle so that it is centered on the mean. Next, it iterates this\nmean-shift step until all the circles stop moving (i.e., until each of them is cen\u2010\ntered on the mean of the instances it contains). This algorithm shifts the circles\nin the direction of higher density, until each of them has found a local density\nmaximum. Finally, all the instances whose circles have settled in the same place\n(or close enough) are assigned to the same cluster. This has some of the same fea\u2010\ntures as DBSCAN, in particular it can find any number of clusters of any shape, it\nhas just one hyperparameter (the radius of the circles, called the bandwidth) and\nit relies on local density estimation. However, it tends to chop clusters into pieces\nwhen they have internal density variations. Unfortunately, its computational\ncomplexity is O(m2), so it is not suited for large datasets.\n\u2022 Affinity propagation: this algorithm uses a voting system, where instances vote for\nsimilar instances to be their representatives, and once the algorithm converges,\neach representative and its voters form a cluster. This algorithm can detect any\nnumber of clusters of different sizes. Unfortunately, this algorithm has a compu\u2010\ntational complexity of O(m2), so it is not suited for large datasets.\n\u2022 Spectral clustering: this algorithm takes a similarity matrix between the instances\nand creates a low-dimensional embedding from it (i.e., it reduces its dimension\u2010\nality), then it uses another clustering algorithm in this low-dimensional space\n(Scikit-Learn\u2019s implementation uses K-Means). Spectral clustering can capture\ncomplex cluster structures, and it can also be used to cut graphs (e.g., to identify\nclusters of friends on a social network), however it does not scale well to large\nnumber of instances, and it does not behave well when the clusters have very dif\u2010\nferent sizes.\nNow let\u2019s dive into Gaussian mixture models, which can be used for density estima\u2010\ntion, clustering and anomaly detection.",

In some applications, this may be sufficient,\nfor example if you want to analyze satellite images to measure how much total forest\narea there is in a region, color segmentation may be just fine.\nFirst, let\u2019s load the image (see the upper left image in Figure 9-12) using Matplotlib\u2019s\nimread() function:\n>>> from matplotlib.image import imread  # you could also use `imageio.imread()`\n>>> image = imread(os.path.join(\"images\",\"clustering\",\"ladybug.png\"))\n>>> image.shape\n(533, 800, 3)\nThe image is represented as a 3D array: the first dimension\u2019s size is the height, the\nsecond is the width, and the third is the number of color channels, in this case red,\ngreen and blue (RGB). In other words, for each pixel there is a 3D vector containing\nthe intensities of red, green and blue, each between 0.0 and 1.0 (or between 0 and 255\nif you use imageio.imread()). Some images may have less channels, such as gray\u2010\nscale images (one channel), or more channels, such as images with an additional\nalpha channel for transparency, or satellite images which often contain channels for\nmany light frequencies (e.g., infrared). The following code reshapes the array to get a\nlong list of RGB colors, then it clusters these colors using K-Means. For example, it\nmay identify a color cluster for all shades of green. Next, for each color (e.g., dark\ngreen), it looks for the mean color of the pixel\u2019s color cluster. For example, all shades\nof green may be replaced with the same light green color (assuming the mean color of\nthe green cluster is light green). Finally it reshapes this long list of colors to get the\nsame shape as the original image. And we\u2019re done!\nX = image.reshape(-1, 3)\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=8).fit(X)\nsegmented_img = kmeans.cluster_centers_[kmeans.labels_]\nsegmented_img = segmented_img.reshape(image.shape)\nThis outputs the image shown in the upper right of Figure 9-12. You can experiment\nwith various numbers of clusters, as shown in the figure. When you use less than 8\nclusters, notice that the ladybug\u2019s flashy red color fails to get a cluster of its own: it",

For example, let\u2019s tackle\nthe digits dataset which is a simple MNIST-like dataset containing 1,797 grayscale 8\u00d78\nimages representing digits 0 to 9. First, let\u2019s load the dataset:\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_digits\nX_digits, y_digits = load_digits(return_X_y=True)\nNow, let\u2019s split it into a training set and a test set:\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_digits, y_digits)\nNext, let\u2019s fit a Logistic Regression model:\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nlog_reg = LogisticRegression(random_state=42)\nlog_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)\nLet\u2019s evaluate its accuracy on the test set:\n>>> log_reg.score(X_test, y_test)\n0.9666666666666667\n|\nChapter 9: Unsupervised Learning Techniques\nOkay, that\u2019s our baseline: 96.7% accuracy. Let\u2019s see if we can do better by using K-\nMeans as a preprocessing step. We will create a pipeline that will first cluster the\ntraining set into 50 clusters and replace the images with their distances to these 50\nclusters, then apply a logistic regression model.\nAlthough it is tempting to define the number of clusters to 10,\nsince there are 10 different digits, it is unlikely to perform well,\nbecause there are several different ways to write each digit.\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\npipeline = Pipeline([\n(\"kmeans\", KMeans(n_clusters=50)),\n(\"log_reg\", LogisticRegression()),\n])\npipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)\nNow let\u2019s evaluate this classification pipeline:\n>>> pipeline.score(X_test, y_test)\n0.9822222222222222\nHow about that? We almost divided the error rate by a factor of 2!\nBut we chose the number of clusters k completely arbitrarily, we can surely do better.\nSince K-Means is just a preprocessing step in a classification pipeline, finding a good\nvalue for k is much simpler than earlier: there\u2019s no need to perform silhouette analysis\nor minimize the inertia, the best value of k is simply the one that results in the best\nclassification performance during cross-validation. Let\u2019s use GridSearchCV to find the\noptimal number of clusters:\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nparam_grid = dict(kmeans__n_clusters=range(2, 100))\ngrid_clf = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid, cv=3, verbose=2)\ngrid_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\nLet\u2019s look at best value for k, and the performance of the resulting pipeline:\n>>> grid_clf.best_params_\n{'kmeans__n_clusters': 90}\n>>> grid_clf.score(X_test, y_test)\n0.9844444444444445\nWith k=90 clusters, we get a small accuracy boost, reaching 98.4% accuracy on the\ntest set.

Let\u2019s see how we can do\nbetter. First, let\u2019s cluster the training set into 50 clusters, then for each cluster let\u2019s find\nthe image closest to the centroid. We will call these images the representative images:\nk = 50\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k)\nX_digits_dist = kmeans.fit_transform(X_train)\nrepresentative_digit_idx = np.argmin(X_digits_dist, axis=0)\nX_representative_digits = X_train[representative_digit_idx]\nFigure 9-13 shows these 50 representative images:\nFigure 9-13.

This is called label propagation:\ny_train_propagated = np.empty(len(X_train), dtype=np.int32)\nfor i in range(k):\ny_train_propagated[kmeans.labels_==i] = y_representative_digits[i]\nNow let\u2019s train the model again and look at its performance:\n>>> log_reg = LogisticRegression()\n>>> log_reg.fit(X_train, y_train_propagated)\n>>> log_reg.score(X_test, y_test)\n0.9288888888888889\nWe got a tiny little accuracy boost. Better than nothing, but not astounding. The\nproblem is that we propagated each representative instance\u2019s label to all the instances\nin the same cluster, including the instances located close to the cluster boundaries,\nwhich are more likely to be mislabeled. Let\u2019s see what happens if we only propagate\nthe labels to the 20% of the instances that are closest to the centroids:\npercentile_closest = 20\nX_cluster_dist = X_digits_dist[np.arange(len(X_train)), kmeans.labels_]\nfor i in range(k):\nin_cluster = (kmeans.labels_ == i)\ncluster_dist = X_cluster_dist[in_cluster]\ncutoff_distance = np.percentile(cluster_dist, percentile_closest)\nabove_cutoff = (X_cluster_dist > cutoff_distance)\nX_cluster_dist[in_cluster & above_cutoff] = -1\npartially_propagated = (X_cluster_dist != -1)\nX_train_partially_propagated = X_train[partially_propagated]\ny_train_partially_propagated = y_train_propagated[partially_propagated]\nNow let\u2019s train the model again on this partially propagated dataset:\n>>> log_reg = LogisticRegression()\n>>> log_reg.fit(X_train_partially_propagated, y_train_partially_propagated)\n>>> log_reg.score(X_test, y_test)\n0.9422222222222222\nNice!

All the instances generated from a single Gaussian distri\u2010\nbution form a cluster that typically looks like an ellipsoid. Each cluster can have a dif\u2010\nferent ellipsoidal shape, size, density and orientation, just like in Figure 9-11. When\nyou observe an instance, you know it was generated from one of the Gaussian distri\u2010\n|\nChapter 9: Unsupervised Learning Techniques\n7 Phi (\u03d5 or \u03c6) is the 21st letter of the Greek alphabet.\n8 Most of these notations are standard, but a few additional notations were taken from the Wikipedia article on\nplate notation.\nbutions, but you are not told which one, and you do not know what the parameters of\nthese distributions are.\nThere are several GMM variants: in the simplest variant, implemented in the Gaus\nsianMixture class, you must know in advance the number k of Gaussian distribu\u2010\ntions. The dataset X is assumed to have been generated through the following\nprobabilistic process:\n\u2022 For each instance, a cluster is picked randomly among k clusters. The probability\nof choosing the jth cluster is defined by the cluster\u2019s weight \u03d5(j).7 The index of the\ncluster chosen for the ith instance is noted z(i).\n\u2022 If z(i)=j, meaning the ith instance has been assigned to the jth cluster, the location\nx(i) of this instance is sampled randomly from the Gaussian distribution with\nmean \u03bc(j) and covariance matrix \u03a3(j). This is noted  i \u223c \u03bc j , \u03a3 j .\nThis generative process can be represented as a graphical model (see Figure 9-16).\nThis is a graph which represents the structure of the conditional dependencies\nbetween random variables.\nFigure 9-16. Gaussian mixture model\nHere is how to interpret it:8\n\u2022 The circles represent random variables.\n\u2022 The squares represent fixed values (i.e., parameters of the model).\nGaussian Mixtures\n|\n\u2022 The large rectangles are called plates: they indicate that their content is repeated\nseveral times.\n\u2022 The number indicated at the bottom right hand side of each plate indicates how\nmany times its content is repeated, so there are m random variables z(i) (from z(1)\nto z(m)) and m random variables x(i), and k means \u03bc(j) and k covariance matrices\n\u03a3(j), but just one weight vector \u03d5 (containing all the weights \u03d5(1) to \u03d5(k)).\n\u2022 Each variable z(i) is drawn from the categorical distribution with weights \u03d5. Each\nvariable x(i) is drawn from the normal distribution with the mean and covariance\nmatrix defined by its cluster z(i).\n\u2022 The solid arrows represent conditional dependencies. For example, the probabil\u2010\nity distribution for each random variable z(i) depends on the weight vector \u03d5.\nNote that when an arrow crosses a plate boundary, it means that it applies to all\nthe repetitions of that plate, so for example the weight vector \u03d5 conditions the\nprobability distributions of all the random variables x(1) to x(m).\n\u2022 The squiggly arrow from z(i) to x(i) represents a switch: depending on the value of\nz(i), the instance x(i) will be sampled from a different Gaussian distribution. For\nexample, if z(i)=j, then  i \u223c \u03bc j , \u03a3 j .\n\u2022 Shaded nodes indicate that the value is known, so in this case only the random\nvariables x(i) have known values: they are called observed variables. The unknown\nrandom variables z(i) are called latent variables.\nSo what can you do with such a model? Well, given the dataset X, you typically want\nto start by estimating the weights \u03d5 and all the distribution parameters \u03bc(1) to \u03bc(k) and\n\u03a3(1) to \u03a3(k). Scikit-Learn\u2019s GaussianMixture class makes this trivial:\nfrom sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture\ngm = GaussianMixture(n_components=3, n_init=10)\ngm.fit(X)\nLet\u2019s look at the parameters that the algorithm estimated:\n>>> gm.weights_\narray([0.20965228, 0.4000662 , 0.39028152])\n>>> gm.means_\narray([[ 3.39909717,  1.05933727],\n[-1.40763984,  1.42710194],\n[ 0.05135313,  0.07524095]])\n>>> gm.covariances_\narray([[[ 1.14807234, -0.03270354],\n[-0.03270354,  0.95496237]],\n[[ 0.63478101,  0.72969804],\n[ 0.72969804,  1.1609872 ]],\n|\nChapter 9: Unsupervised Learning Techniques\n[[ 0.68809572,  0.79608475],\n[ 0.79608475,  1.21234145]]])\nGreat, it worked fine! Indeed, the weights that were used to generate the data were\n0.2, 0.4 and 0.4, and similarly, the means and covariance matrices were very close to\nthose found by the algorithm. But how? This class relies on the Expectation-\nMaximization (EM) algorithm, which has many similarities with the K-Means algo\u2010\nrithm: it also initializes the cluster parameters randomly, then it repeats two steps\nuntil convergence, first assigning instances to clusters (this is called the expectation\nstep) then updating the clusters (this is called the maximization step). Sounds famil\u2010\niar? Indeed, in the context of clustering you can think of EM as a generalization of K-\nMeans which not only finds the cluster centers (\u03bc(1) to \u03bc(k)), but also their size, shape\nand orientation (\u03a3(1) to \u03a3(k)), as well as their relative weights (\u03d5(1) to \u03d5(k)). Unlike K-\nMeans, EM uses soft cluster assignments rather than hard assignments: for each\ninstance during the expectation step, the algorithm estimates the probability that it\nbelongs to each cluster (based on the current cluster parameters). Then, during the\nmaximization step, each cluster is updated using all the instances in the dataset, with\neach instance weighted by the estimated probability that it belongs to that cluster.\nThese probabilities are called the responsibilities of the clusters for the instances. Dur\u2010\ning the maximization step, each cluster\u2019s update will mostly be impacted by the\ninstances it is most responsible for.\nUnfortunately, just like K-Means, EM can end up converging to\npoor solutions, so it needs to be run several times, keeping only the\nbest solution. This is why we set n_init to 10. Be careful: by default\nn_init is only set to 1.\nYou can check whether or not the algorithm converged and how many iterations it\ntook:\n>>> gm.converged_\nTrue\n>>> gm.n_iter_\nOkay, now that you have an estimate of the location, size, shape, orientation and rela\u2010\ntive weight of each cluster, the model can easily assign each instance to the most likely\ncluster (hard clustering) or estimate the probability that it belongs to a particular\ncluster (soft clustering). For this, just use the predict() method for hard clustering,\nor the predict_proba() method for soft clustering:\n>>> gm.predict(X)\narray([2, 2, 1, ..., 0, 0, 0])\n>>> gm.predict_proba(X)\narray([[2.32389467e-02, 6.77397850e-07, 9.76760376e-01],\n[1.64685609e-02, 6.75361303e-04, 9.82856078e-01],\nGaussian Mixtures\n|\n[2.01535333e-06, 9.99923053e-01, 7.49319577e-05],\n...,\n[9.99999571e-01, 2.13946075e-26, 4.28788333e-07],\n[1.00000000e+00, 1.46454409e-41, 5.12459171e-16],\n[1.00000000e+00, 8.02006365e-41, 2.27626238e-15]])\nIt is a generative model, meaning you can actually sample new instances from it (note\nthat they are ordered by cluster index):\n>>> X_new, y_new = gm.sample(6)\n>>> X_new\narray([[ 2.95400315,  2.63680992],\n[-1.16654575,  1.62792705],\n[-1.39477712, -1.48511338],\n[ 0.27221525,  0.690366  ],\n[ 0.54095936,  0.48591934],\n[ 0.38064009, -0.56240465]])\n>>> y_new\narray([0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2])\nIt is also possible to estimate the density of the model at any given location. This is\nachieved using the score_samples() method: for each instance it is given, this\nmethod estimates the log of the probability density function (PDF) at that location.\nThe greater the score, the higher the density:\n>>> gm.score_samples(X)\narray([-2.60782346, -3.57106041, -3.33003479, ..., -3.51352783,\n-4.39802535, -3.80743859])\nIf you compute the exponential of these scores, you get the value of the PDF at the\nlocation of the given instances. These are not probabilities, but probability densities:\nthey can take on any positive value, not just between 0 and 1. To estimate the proba\u2010\nbility that an instance will fall within a particular region, you would have to integrate\nthe PDF over that region (if you do so over the entire space of possible instance loca\u2010\ntions, the result will be 1).\nFigure 9-17 shows the cluster means, the decision boundaries (dashed lines), and the\ndensity contours of this model:\n|\nChapter 9: Unsupervised Learning Techniques\nFigure 9-17.

Of course, we made its task\neasy by actually generating the data using a set of 2D Gaussian distributions (unfortu\u2010\nnately, real life data is not always so Gaussian and low-dimensional), and we also gave\nthe algorithm the correct number of clusters. When there are many dimensions, or\nmany clusters, or few instances, EM can struggle to converge to the optimal solution.\nYou might need to reduce the difficulty of the task by limiting the number of parame\u2010\nters that the algorithm has to learn: one way to do this is to limit the range of shapes\nand orientations that the clusters can have. This can be achieved by imposing con\u2010\nstraints on the covariance matrices. To do this, just set the covariance_type hyper\u2010\nparameter to one of the following values:\n\u2022 \"spherical\": all clusters must be spherical, but they can have different diameters\n(i.e., different variances).\n\u2022 \"diag\": clusters can take on any ellipsoidal shape of any size, but the ellipsoid\u2019s\naxes must be parallel to the coordinate axes (i.e., the covariance matrices must be\ndiagonal).\n\u2022 \"tied\": all clusters must have the same ellipsoidal shape, size and orientation\n(i.e., all clusters share the same covariance matrix).\nBy default, covariance_type is equal to \"full\", which means that each cluster can\ntake on any shape, size and orientation (it has its own unconstrained covariance\nmatrix). Figure 9-18 plots the solutions found by the EM algorithm when cova\nriance_type is set to \"tied\" or \"spherical\u201c.\nGaussian Mixtures\n|\nFigure 9-18. covariance_type_diagram\nThe computational complexity of training a GaussianMixture\nmodel depends on the number of instances m, the number of\ndimensions n, the number of clusters k, and the constraints on the\ncovariance matrices. If covariance_type is \"spherical or \"diag\",\nit is O(kmn), assuming the data has a clustering structure. If cova\nriance_type is \"tied\" or \"full\", it is O(kmn2 + kn3), so it will not\nscale to large numbers of features.\nGaussian mixture models can also be used for anomaly detection. Let\u2019s see how.\nGaussian Mixtures\n|\nmation criterion such as the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) or the Akaike\ninformation criterion (AIC), defined in Equation 9-1.\nEquation 9-1. Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and Akaike information\ncriterion (AIC)\nBIC =\nlog m p \u22122 log L\nAIC =\n2p \u22122 log L\n\u2022 m is the number of instances, as always.\n\u2022 p is the number of parameters learned by the model.\n\u2022 L is the maximized value of the likelihood function of the model.\nBoth the BIC and the AIC penalize models that have more parameters to learn (e.g.,\nmore clusters), and reward models that fit the data well. They often end up selecting\nthe same model, but when they differ, the model selected by the BIC tends to be sim\u2010\npler (fewer parameters) than the one selected by the AIC, but it does not fit the data\nquite as well (this is especially true for larger datasets).\nLikelihood function\nThe terms \u201cprobability\u201d and \u201clikelihood\u201d are often used interchangeably in the\nEnglish language, but they have very different meanings in statistics: given a statistical\nmodel with some parameters \u03b8, the word \u201cprobability\u201d is used to describe how plausi\u2010\nble a future outcome x is (knowing the parameter values \u03b8), while the word \u201clikeli\u2010\nhood\u201d is used to describe how plausible a particular set of parameter values \u03b8 are,\nafter the outcome x is known.\nConsider a one-dimensional mixture model of two Gaussian distributions centered at\n-4 and +1. For simplicity, this toy model has a single parameter \u03b8 that controls the\nstandard deviations of both distributions. The top left contour plot in Figure 9-20\nshows the entire model f(x; \u03b8) as a function of both x and \u03b8. To estimate the probabil\u2010\nity distribution of a future outcome x, you need to set the model parameter \u03b8. For\nexample, if you set it to \u03b8=1.3 (the horizontal line), you get the probability density\nfunction f(x; \u03b8=1.3) shown in the lower left plot. Say you want to estimate the proba\u2010\nbility that x will fall between -2 and +2, you must calculate the integral of the PDF on\nthis range (i.e., the surface of the shaded region). On the other hand, if you have\nobserved a single instance x=2.5 (the vertical line in the upper left plot), you get the\nlikelihood function noted \u2112(\u03b8|x=2.5)=f(x=2.5; \u03b8) represented in the upper right plot.\nIn short, the PDF is a function of x (with \u03b8 fixed) while the likelihood function is a\nfunction of \u03b8 (with x fixed). It is important to understand that the likelihood function\nis not a probability distribution: if you integrate a probability distribution over all\n|\nChapter 9: Unsupervised Learning Techniques\npossible values of x, you always get 1, but if you integrate the likelihood function over\nall possible values of \u03b8, the result can be any positive value.\nFigure 9-20. A model\u2019s parametric function (top left), and some derived functions: a PDF\n(lower left), a likelihood function (top right) and a log likelihood function (lower right)\nGiven a dataset X, a common task is to try to estimate the most likely values for the\nmodel parameters. To do this, you must find the values that maximize the likelihood\nfunction, given X. In this example, if you have observed a single instance x=2.5, the\nmaximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of \u03b8 is \u03b8=1.5. If a prior probability distribution g\nover \u03b8 exists, it is possible to take it into account by maximizing \u2112(\u03b8|x)g(\u03b8) rather\nthan just maximizing \u2112(\u03b8|x). This is called maximum a-posteriori (MAP) estimation.\nSince MAP constrains the parameter values, you can think of it as a regularized ver\u2010\nsion of MLE.\nNotice that it is equivalent to maximize the likelihood function or to maximize its\nlogarithm (represented in the lower right hand side of Figure 9-20): indeed, the loga\u2010\nrithm is a strictly increasing function, so if \u03b8 maximizes the log likelihood, it also\nmaximizes the likelihood. It turns out that it is generally easier to maximize the log\nlikelihood. For example, if you observed several independent instances x(1) to x(m), you\nwould need to find the value of \u03b8 that maximizes the product of the individual likeli\u2010\nhood functions. But it is equivalent, and much simpler, to maximize the sum (not the\nproduct) of the log likelihood functions, thanks to the magic of the logarithm which\nconverts products into sums: log(ab)=log(a)+log(b).\nOnce you have estimated \u03b8, the value of \u03b8 that maximizes the likelihood function,\nthen you are ready to compute L = \u2112\u03b8,  . This is the value which is used to com\u2010\npute the AIC and BIC: you can think of it as a measure of how well the model fits the\ndata.\nTo compute the BIC and AIC, just call the bic() or aic() methods:\nGaussian Mixtures\n|\n>>> gm.bic(X)\n8189.74345832983\n>>> gm.aic(X)\n8102.518178214792\nFigure 9-21 shows the BIC for different numbers of clusters k. As you can see, both\nthe BIC and the AIC are lowest when k=3, so it is most likely the best choice. Note\nthat we could also search for the best value for the covariance_type hyperparameter.\nFor example, if it is \"spherical\" rather than \"full\", then the model has much fewer\nparameters to learn, but it does not fit the data as well.\nFigure 9-21. AIC and BIC for different numbers of clusters k\nGaussian Mixtures\n|\nBayes\u2019 theorem (Equation 9-2) tells us how to update the probability distribution over\nthe latent variables after we observe some data X. It computes the posterior distribu\u2010\ntion p(z|X), which is the conditional probability of z given X.\nEquation 9-2. Bayes\u2019 theorem\np z X = Posterior = Likelihood\u00d7Prior\nEvidence\n= p X z p z\np X\nUnfortunately, in a Gaussian mixture model (and many other problems), the denomi\u2010\nnator p(x) is intractable, as it requires integrating over all the possible values of z\n(Equation 9-3). This means considering all possible combinations of cluster parame\u2010\nters and cluster assignments.\nEquation 9-3. The evidence p(X) is often intractable\np X =\u222bp X z p z dz\nThis is one of the central problems in Bayesian statistics, and there are several\napproaches to solving it. One of them is variational inference, which picks a family of\ndistributions q(z; \u03bb) with its own variational parameters \u03bb (lambda), then it optimizes\nthese parameters to make q(z) a good approximation of p(z|X). This is achieved by\nfinding the value of \u03bb that minimizes the KL divergence from q(z) to p(z|X), noted\nDKL(q\u2016p). The KL divergence equation is shown in (see Equation 9-4), and it can be\nrewritten as the log of the evidence (log p(X)) minus the evidence lower bound\n(ELBO). Since the log of the evidence does not depend on q, it is a constant term, so\nminimizing the KL divergence just requires maximizing the ELBO.\nEquation 9-4.

In mean field varia\u2010\ntional inference, it is necessary to pick the family of distributions q(z; \u03bb) and the prior\np(z) very carefully to ensure that the equation for the ELBO simplifies to a form that\ncan actually be computed. Unfortunately, there is no general way to do this, it\ndepends on the task and requires some mathematical skills. For example, the distribu\u2010\ntions and lower bound equations used in Scikit-Learn\u2019s BayesianGaussianMixture\nclass are presented in the documentation. From these equations it is possible to derive\nupdate equations for the cluster parameters and assignment variables: these are then\nused very much like in the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. In fact, the compu\u2010\ntational complexity of the BayesianGaussianMixture class is similar to that of the\nGaussianMixture class (but generally significantly slower). A simpler approach to\nmaximizing the ELBO is called black box stochastic variational inference (BBSVI): at\neach iteration, a few samples are drawn from q and they are used to estimate the gra\u2010\ndients of the ELBO with regards to the variational parameters \u03bb, which are then used\nin a gradient ascent step. This approach makes it possible to use Bayesian inference\nwith any kind of model (provided it is differentiable), even deep neural networks: this\nis called Bayesian deep learning.\nIf you want to dive deeper into Bayesian statistics, check out the\nBayesian Data Analysis book by Andrew Gelman, John Carlin, Hal\nStern, David Dunson, Aki Vehtari, and Donald Rubin.\nGaussian mixture models work great on clusters with ellipsoidal shapes, but if you try\nto fit a dataset with different shapes, you may have bad surprises. For example, let\u2019s\nsee what happens if we use a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model to cluster the moons\ndataset (see Figure 9-24):\nFigure 9-24. moons_vs_bgm_diagram\nOops, the algorithm desperately searched for ellipsoids, so it found 8 different clus\u2010\nters instead of 2. The density estimation is not too bad, so this model could perhaps\nbe used for anomaly detection, but it failed to identify the two moons. Let\u2019s now look\nat a few clustering algorithms capable of dealing with arbitrarily shaped clusters.\nGaussian Mixtures\n|",

These instances are of course called anomalies or\noutliers, while the normal instances are called inliers. Anomaly detection is very use\u2010\nful in a wide variety of applications, for example in fraud detection, or for detecting\ndefective products in manufacturing, or to remove outliers from a dataset before\ntraining another model, which can significantly improve the performance of the\nresulting model.\nUsing a Gaussian mixture model for anomaly detection is quite simple: any instance\nlocated in a low-density region can be considered an anomaly. You must define what\ndensity threshold you want to use. For example, in a manufacturing company that\ntries to detect defective products, the ratio of defective products is usually well-\nknown. Say it is equal to 4%, then you can set the density threshold to be the value\nthat results in having 4% of the instances located in areas below that threshold den\u2010\nsity. If you notice that you get too many false positives (i.e., perfectly good products\nthat are flagged as defective), you can lower the threshold. Conversely, if you have too\nmany false negatives (i.e., defective products that the system does not flag as defec\u2010\ntive), you can increase the threshold. This is the usual precision/recall tradeoff (see\nChapter 3). Here is how you would identify the outliers using the 4th percentile low\u2010\n|\nChapter 9: Unsupervised Learning Techniques\nest density as the threshold (i.e., approximately 4% of the instances will be flagged as\nanomalies):\ndensities = gm.score_samples(X)\ndensity_threshold = np.percentile(densities, 4)\nanomalies = X[densities < density_threshold]\nThese anomalies are represented as stars on Figure 9-19:\nFigure 9-19. Anomaly detection using a Gaussian mixture model\nA closely related task is novelty detection: it differs from anomaly detection in that the\nalgorithm is assumed to be trained on a \u201cclean\u201d dataset, uncontaminated by outliers,\nwhereas anomaly detection does not make this assumption. Indeed, outlier detection\nis often precisely used to clean up a dataset.\nGaussian mixture models try to fit all the data, including the outli\u2010\ners, so if you have too many of them, this will bias the model\u2019s view\nof \u201cnormality\u201d: some outliers may wrongly be considered as nor\u2010\nmal. If this happens, you can try to fit the model once, use it to\ndetect and remove the most extreme outliers, then fit the model\nagain on the cleaned up dataset. Another approach is to use robust\ncovariance estimation methods (see the EllipticEnvelope class).\nJust like K-Means, the GaussianMixture algorithm requires you to specify the num\u2010\nber of clusters.

It assumes that the normal instances (inliers) are generated\nfrom a single Gaussian distribution (not a mixture), but it also assumes that the\ndataset is contaminated with outliers that were not generated from this Gaussian\ndistribution. When it estimates the parameters of the Gaussian distribution (i.e.,\nthe shape of the elliptic envelope around the inliers), it is careful to ignore the\ninstances that are most likely outliers. This gives a better estimation of the elliptic\nenvelope, and thus makes it better at identifying the outliers.\n\u2022 Isolation forest: this is an efficient algorithm for outlier detection, especially in\nhigh-dimensional datasets. The algorithm builds a Random Forest in which each\nDecision Tree is grown randomly: at each node, it picks a feature randomly, then\nit picks a random threshold value (between the min and max value) to split the\ndataset in two. The dataset gradually gets chopped into pieces this way, until all\ninstances end up isolated from the other instances. An anomaly is usually far\nfrom other instances, so on average (across all the Decision Trees) it tends to get\nisolated in less steps than normal instances.\n\u2022 Local outlier factor (LOF): this algorithm is also good for outlier detection. It\ncompares the density of instances around a given instance to the density around\nits neighbors. An anomaly is often more isolated than its k nearest neighbors.\n\u2022 One-class SVM: this algorithm is better suited for novelty detection. Recall that a\nkernelized SVM classifier separates two classes by first (implicitly) mapping all\nthe instances to a high-dimensional space, then separating the two classes using a\nlinear SVM classifier within this high-dimensional space (see Chapter 5). Since\nwe just have one class of instances, the one-class SVM algorithm instead tries to\nseparate the instances in high-dimensional space from the origin. In the original\nspace, this will correspond to finding a small region that encompasses all the\ninstances. If a new instance does not fall within this region, it is an anomaly.\nThere are a few hyperparameters to tweak: the usual ones for a kernelized SVM,\nplus a margin hyperparameter that corresponds to the probability of a new\ninstance being mistakenly considered as novel, when it is in fact normal. It works\ngreat, especially with high-dimensional datasets, but just like all SVMs, it does\nnot scale to large datasets.\n|\nChapter 9: Unsupervised Learning Techniques\nNeural Networks and Deep Learning\n1 You can get the best of both worlds by being open to biological inspirations without being afraid to create\nbiologically unrealistic models, as long as they work well.\nIntroduction to Artificial Neural Networks\nwith Keras\nWith Early Release ebooks, you get books in their earliest form\u2014\nthe author\u2019s raw and unedited content as he or she writes\u2014so you\ncan take advantage of these technologies long before the official\nrelease of these titles.

It seems only logical, then, to look at the brain\u2019s archi\u2010\ntecture for inspiration on how to build an intelligent machine. This is the key idea\nthat sparked artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, although planes were\ninspired by birds, they don\u2019t have to flap their wings. Similarly, ANNs have gradually\nbecome quite different from their biological cousins. Some researchers even argue\nthat we should drop the biological analogy altogether (e.g., by saying \u201cunits\u201d rather\nthan \u201cneurons\u201d), lest we restrict our creativity to biologically plausible systems.1\nANNs are at the very core of Deep Learning. They are versatile, powerful, and scala\u2010\nble, making them ideal to tackle large and highly complex Machine Learning tasks,\nsuch as classifying billions of images (e.g., Google Images), powering speech recogni\u2010\ntion services (e.g., Apple\u2019s Siri), recommending the best videos to watch to hundreds\nof millions of users every day (e.g., YouTube), or learning to beat the world champion\nat the game of Go by playing millions of games against itself (DeepMind\u2019s Alpha\u2010\nZero).\n2 \u201cA Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity,\u201d W.

When it became clear that\nthis promise would go unfulfilled (at least for quite a while), funding flew elsewhere\nand ANNs entered a long winter. In the early 1980s there was a revival of interest in\nconnectionism (the study of neural networks), as new architectures were invented and\nbetter training techniques were developed. But progress was slow, and by the 1990s\nother powerful Machine Learning techniques were invented, such as Support Vector\nMachines (see Chapter 5). These techniques seemed to offer better results and stron\u2010\nger theoretical foundations than ANNs, so once again the study of neural networks\nentered a long winter.\nFinally, we are now witnessing yet another wave of interest in ANNs.

Well, there are a few good reasons to believe that\nthis wave is different and that it will have a much more profound impact on our lives:\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\n\u2022 There is now a huge quantity of data available to train neural networks, and\nANNs frequently outperform other ML techniques on very large and complex\nproblems.\n\u2022 The tremendous increase in computing power since the 1990s now makes it pos\u2010\nsible to train large neural networks in a reasonable amount of time. This is in\npart due to Moore\u2019s Law, but also thanks to the gaming industry, which has pro\u2010\nduced powerful GPU cards by the millions.\n\u2022 The training algorithms have been improved. To be fair they are only slightly dif\u2010\nferent from the ones used in the 1990s, but these relatively small tweaks have a\nhuge positive impact.\n\u2022 Some theoretical limitations of ANNs have turned out to be benign in practice.\nFor example, many people thought that ANN training algorithms were doomed\nbecause they were likely to get stuck in local optima, but it turns out that this is\nrather rare in practice (or when it is the case, they are usually fairly close to the\nglobal optimum).\n\u2022 ANNs seem to have entered a virtuous circle of funding and progress. Amazing\nproducts based on ANNs regularly make the headline news, which pulls more\nand more attention and funding toward them, resulting in more and more pro\u2010\ngress, and even more amazing products.\nFrom Biological to Artificial Neurons\n|\n3 Image by Bruce Blaus (Creative Commons 3.0).

Biological neuron3\nThus, individual biological neurons seem to behave in a rather simple way, but they\nare organized in a vast network of billions of neurons, each neuron typically connec\u2010\nted to thousands of other neurons. Highly complex computations can be performed\nby a vast network of fairly simple neurons, much like a complex anthill can emerge\nfrom the combined efforts of simple ants. The architecture of biological neural net\u2010\nworks (BNN)4 is still the subject of active research, but some parts of the brain have\nbeen mapped, and it seems that neurons are often organized in consecutive layers, as\nshown in Figure 10-2.\nFigure 10-2. Multiple layers in a biological neural network (human cortex)5\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\nFrom Biological to Artificial Neurons\n|\n6 The name Perceptron is sometimes used to mean a tiny network with a single TLU.\na threshold logic unit (TLU), or sometimes a linear threshold unit (LTU): the inputs\nand output are now numbers (instead of binary on/off values) and each input con\u2010\nnection is associated with a weight. The TLU computes a weighted sum of its inputs\n(z = w1 x1 + w2 x2 + \u22ef + wn xn = xT w), then applies a step function to that sum and\noutputs the result: hw(x) = step(z), where z = xT w.\nFigure 10-4. Threshold logic unit\nThe most common step function used in Perceptrons is the Heaviside step function\n(see Equation 10-1). Sometimes the sign function is used instead.\nEquation 10-1. Common step functions used in Perceptrons\nheaviside z = 0 if z < 0\n1 if z \u22650\nsgn z =\n\u22121 if z < 0\nif z = 0\n+1 if z > 0\nA single TLU can be used for simple linear binary classification. It computes a linear\ncombination of the inputs and if the result exceeds a threshold, it outputs the positive\nclass or else outputs the negative class (just like a Logistic Regression classifier or a\nlinear SVM). For example, you could use a single TLU to classify iris flowers based on\nthe petal length and width (also adding an extra bias feature x0 = 1, just like we did in\nprevious chapters). Training a TLU in this case means finding the right values for w0,\nw1, and w2 (the training algorithm is discussed shortly).\nA Perceptron is simply composed of a single layer of TLUs,6 with each TLU connected\nto all the inputs. When all the neurons in a layer are connected to every neuron in the\nprevious layer (i.e., its input neurons), it is called a fully connected layer or a dense\nlayer. To represent the fact that each input is sent to every TLU, it is common to draw\nspecial passthrough neurons called input neurons: they just output whatever input\nthey are fed. All the input neurons form the input layer. Moreover, an extra bias fea\u2010\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\nture is generally added (x0 = 1): it is typically represented using a special type of neu\u2010\nron called a bias neuron, which just outputs 1 all the time. A Perceptron with two\ninputs and three outputs is represented in Figure 10-5. This Perceptron can classify\ninstances simultaneously into three different binary classes, which makes it a multi\u2010\noutput classifier.\nFigure 10-5. Perceptron diagram\nThanks to the magic of linear algebra, it is possible to efficiently compute the outputs\nof a layer of artificial neurons for several instances at once, by using Equation 10-2:\nEquation 10-2. Computing the outputs of a fully connected layer\nhW, b X = \u03d5 XW + b\n\u2022 As always, X represents the matrix of input features. It has one row per instance,\none column per feature.\n\u2022 The weight matrix W contains all the connection weights except for the ones\nfrom the bias neuron. It has one row per input neuron and one column per artifi\u2010\ncial neuron in the layer.\n\u2022 The bias vector b contains all the connection weights between the bias neuron\nand the artificial neurons. It has one bias term per artificial neuron.\n\u2022 The function \u03d5 is called the activation function: when the artificial neurons are\nTLUs, it is a step function (but we will discuss other activation functions shortly).\nSo how is a Perceptron trained? The Perceptron training algorithm proposed by\nFrank Rosenblatt was largely inspired by Hebb\u2019s rule. In his book The Organization of\nBehavior, published in 1949, Donald Hebb suggested that when a biological neuron\noften triggers another neuron, the connection between these two neurons grows\nstronger. This idea was later summarized by Siegrid L\u00f6wel in this catchy phrase:\n\u201cCells that fire together, wire together.\u201d This rule later became known as Hebb\u2019s rule\nFrom Biological to Artificial Neurons\n|\n7 Note that this solution is generally not unique: in general when the data are linearly separable, there is an\ninfinity of hyperplanes that can separate them.\n(or Hebbian learning); that is, the connection weight between two neurons is\nincreased whenever they have the same output. Perceptrons are trained using a var\u2010\niant of this rule that takes into account the error made by the network; it reinforces\nconnections that help reduce the error. More specifically, the Perceptron is fed one\ntraining instance at a time, and for each instance it makes its predictions. For every\noutput neuron that produced a wrong prediction, it reinforces the connection\nweights from the inputs that would have contributed to the correct prediction. The\nrule is shown in Equation 10-3.\nEquation 10-3. Perceptron learning rule (weight update)\nwi, j\nnext step = wi, j + \u03b7 yj \u2212y j xi\n\u2022 wi, j is the connection weight between the ith input neuron and the jth output neu\u2010\nron.\n\u2022 xi is the ith input value of the current training instance.\n\u2022 y j is the output of the jth output neuron for the current training instance.\n\u2022 yj is the target output of the jth output neuron for the current training instance.\n\u2022 \u03b7 is the learning rate.\nThe decision boundary of each output neuron is linear, so Perceptrons are incapable\nof learning complex patterns (just like Logistic Regression classifiers). However, if the\ntraining instances are linearly separable, Rosenblatt demonstrated that this algorithm\nwould converge to a solution.7 This is called the Perceptron convergence theorem.\nScikit-Learn provides a Perceptron class that implements a single TLU network. It\ncan be used pretty much as you would expect\u2014for example, on the iris dataset (intro\u2010\nduced in Chapter 4):\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Perceptron\niris = load_iris()\nX = iris.data[:, (2, 3)]  # petal length, petal width\ny = (iris.target == 0).astype(np.int)  # Iris Setosa?\nper_clf = Perceptron()\nper_clf.fit(X, y)\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\ny_pred = per_clf.predict([[2, 0.5]])\nYou may have noticed the fact that the Perceptron learning algorithm strongly resem\u2010\nbles Stochastic Gradient Descent. In fact, Scikit-Learn\u2019s Perceptron class is equivalent\nto using an SGDClassifier with the following hyperparameters: loss=\"perceptron\",\nlearning_rate=\"constant\", eta0=1 (the learning rate), and penalty=None (no regu\u2010\nlarization).\nNote that contrary to Logistic Regression classifiers, Perceptrons do not output a class\nprobability; rather, they just make predictions based on a hard threshold. This is one\nof the good reasons to prefer Logistic Regression over Perceptrons.\nIn their 1969 monograph titled Perceptrons, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert\nhighlighted a number of serious weaknesses of Perceptrons, in particular the fact that\nthey are incapable of solving some trivial problems (e.g., the Exclusive OR (XOR)\nclassification problem; see the left side of Figure 10-6). Of course this is true of any\nother linear classification model as well (such as Logistic Regression classifiers), but\nresearchers had expected much more from Perceptrons, and their disappointment\nwas great, and many researchers dropped neural networks altogether in favor of\nhigher-level problems such as logic, problem solving, and search.\nHowever, it turns out that some of the limitations of Perceptrons can be eliminated by\nstacking multiple Perceptrons. The resulting ANN is called a Multi-Layer Perceptron\n(MLP). In particular, an MLP can solve the XOR problem, as you can verify by com\u2010\nputing the output of the MLP represented on the right of Figure 10-6: with inputs (0,\n0) or (1, 1) the network outputs 0, and with inputs (0, 1) or (1, 0) it outputs 1. All\nconnections have a weight equal to 1, except the four connections where the weight is\nshown. Try verifying that this network indeed solves the XOR problem!\nFigure 10-6. XOR classification problem and an MLP that solves it\nFrom Biological to Artificial Neurons\n|\n8 In the 1990s, an ANN with more than two hidden layers was considered deep. Nowadays, it is common to see\nANNs with dozens of layers, or even hundreds, so the definition of \u201cdeep\u201d is quite fuzzy.\n9 \u201cLearning Internal Representations by Error Propagation,\u201d D. Rumelhart, G. Hinton, R. Williams (1986).\nFrom Biological to Artificial Neurons\n|\nnetwork by propagating the error gradient backward through the network (hence\nthe name of the algorithm).\n\u2022 Finally, the algorithm performs a Gradient Descent step to tweak all the connec\u2010\ntion weights in the network, using the error gradients it just computed.\nThis algorithm is so important, it\u2019s worth summarizing it again: for each training\ninstance the backpropagation algorithm first makes a prediction (forward pass),\nmeasures the error, then goes through each layer in reverse to measure the error con\u2010\ntribution from each connection (reverse pass), and finally slightly tweaks the connec\u2010\ntion weights to reduce the error (Gradient Descent step).\nIt is important to initialize all the hidden layers\u2019 connection weights\nrandomly, or else training will fail. For example, if you initialize all\nweights and biases to zero, then all neurons in a given layer will be\nperfectly identical, and thus backpropagation will affect them in\nexactly the same way, so they will remain identical. In other words,\ndespite having hundreds of neurons per layer, your model will act\nas if it had only one neuron per layer: it won\u2019t be too smart. If\ninstead you randomly initialize the weights, you break the symme\u2010\ntry and allow backpropagation to train a diverse team of neurons.\nIn order for this algorithm to work properly, the authors made a key change to the\nMLP\u2019s architecture: they replaced the step function with the logistic function, \u03c3(z) =\n1 / (1 + exp(\u2013z)). This was essential because the step function contains only flat seg\u2010\nments, so there is no gradient to work with (Gradient Descent cannot move on a flat\nsurface), while the logistic function has a well-defined nonzero derivative every\u2010\nwhere, allowing Gradient Descent to make some progress at every step. In fact, the\nbackpropagation algorithm works well with many other activation functions, not just\nthe logistic function. Two other popular activation functions are:\nThe hyperbolic tangent function tanh(z) = 2\u03c3(2z) \u2013 1\nJust like the logistic function it is S-shaped, continuous, and differentiable, but its\noutput value ranges from \u20131 to 1 (instead of 0 to 1 in the case of the logistic func\u2010\ntion), which tends to make each layer\u2019s output more or less centered around 0 at\nthe beginning of training. This often helps speed up convergence.\nThe Rectified Linear Unit function: ReLU(z) = max(0, z)\nIt is continuous but unfortunately not differentiable at z = 0 (the slope changes\nabruptly, which can make Gradient Descent bounce around), and its derivative is\n0 for z < 0. However, in practice it works very well and has the advantage of being\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\n11 Biological neurons seem to implement a roughly sigmoid (S-shaped) activation function, so researchers stuck\nto sigmoid functions for a very long time. But it turns out that ReLU generally works better in ANNs. This is\none of the cases where the biological analogy was misleading.\nfast to compute11. Most importantly, the fact that it does not have a maximum\noutput value also helps reduce some issues during Gradient Descent (we will\ncome back to this in Chapter 11).\nThese popular activation functions and their derivatives are represented in\nFigure 10-8. But wait! Why do we need activation functions in the first place? Well, if\nyou chain several linear transformations, all you get is a linear transformation. For\nexample, say f(x) = 2 x + 3 and g(x) = 5 x - 1, then chaining these two linear functions\ngives you another linear function: f(g(x)) = 2(5 x - 1) + 3 = 10 x + 1. So if you don\u2019t\nhave some non-linearity between layers, then even a deep stack of layers is equivalent\nto a single layer: you cannot solve very complex problems with that.\nFigure 10-8. Activation functions and their derivatives\nOkay! So now you know where neural nets came from, what their architecture is and\nhow to compute their outputs, and you also learned about the backpropagation algo\u2010\nrithm. But what exactly can you do with them?\nFrom Biological to Artificial Neurons\n|\nIn general, when building an MLP for regression, you do not want to use any activa\u2010\ntion function for the output neurons, so they are free to output any range of values.\nHowever, if you want to guarantee that the output will always be positive, then you\ncan use the ReLU activation function, or the softplus activation function in the output\nlayer. Finally, if you want to guarantee that the predictions will fall within a given\nrange of values, then you can use the logistic function or the hyperbolic tangent, and\nscale the labels to the appropriate range: 0 to 1 for the logistic function, or \u20131 to 1 for\nthe hyperbolic tangent.\nThe loss function to use during training is typically the mean squared error, but if you\nhave a lot of outliers in the training set, you may prefer to use the mean absolute\nerror instead. Alternatively, you can use the Huber loss, which is a combination of\nboth.\nThe Huber loss is quadratic when the error is smaller than a thres\u2010\nhold \u03b4 (typically 1), but linear when the error is larger than \u03b4. This\nmakes it less sensitive to outliers than the mean squared error, and\nit is often more precise and converges faster than the mean abso\u2010\nlute error.\nTable 10-1 summarizes the typical architecture of a regression MLP.\nTable 10-1.

The field of Deep Learning studies DNNs, and more generally models\ncontaining deep stacks of computations. However, many people talk about Deep\nLearning whenever neural networks are involved (even shallow ones).\nFor many years researchers struggled to find a way to train MLPs, without success.\nBut in 1986, David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton and Ronald Williams published a\ngroundbreaking paper9 introducing the backpropagation training algorithm, which is\nstill used today. In short, it is simply Gradient Descent (introduced in Chapter 4)\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\n10 This technique was actually independently invented several times by various researchers in different fields,\nstarting with P. Werbos in 1974.\nusing an efficient technique for computing the gradients automatically10: in just two\npasses through the network (one forward, one backward), the backpropagation algo\u2010\nrithm is able to compute the gradient of the network\u2019s error with regards to every sin\u2010\ngle model parameter. In other words, it can find out how each connection weight and\neach bias term should be tweaked in order to reduce the error. Once it has these gra\u2010\ndients, it just performs a regular Gradient Descent step, and the whole process is\nrepeated until the network converges to the solution.\nAutomatically computing gradients is called automatic differentia\u2010\ntion, or autodiff. There are various autodiff techniques, with differ\u2010\nent pros and cons. The one used by backpropagation is called\nreverse-mode autodiff. It is fast and precise, and is well suited when\nthe function to differentiate has many variables (e.g., connection\nweights) and few outputs (e.g., one loss). If you want to learn more\nabout autodiff, check out ???.\nLet\u2019s run through this algorithm in a bit more detail:\n\u2022 It handles one mini-batch at a time (for example containing 32 instances each),\nand it goes through the full training set multiple times. Each pass is called an\nepoch, as we saw in Chapter 4.\n\u2022 Each mini-batch is passed to the network\u2019s input layer, which just sends it to the\nfirst hidden layer. The algorithm then computes the output of all the neurons in\nthis layer (for every instance in the mini-batch). The result is passed on to the\nnext layer, its output is computed and passed to the next layer, and so on until we\nget the output of the last layer, the output layer. This is the forward pass: it is\nexactly like making predictions, except all intermediate results are preserved\nsince they are needed for the backward pass.\n\u2022 Next, the algorithm measures the network\u2019s output error (i.e., it uses a loss func\u2010\ntion that compares the desired output and the actual output of the network, and\nreturns some measure of the error).\n\u2022 Then it computes how much each output connection contributed to the error.\nThis is done analytically by simply applying the chain rule (perhaps the most fun\u2010\ndamental rule in calculus), which makes this step fast and precise.\n\u2022 The algorithm then measures how much of these error contributions came from\neach connection in the layer below, again using the chain rule\u2014and so on until\nthe algorithm reaches the input layer.

For\nexample, you could have an email classification system that predicts whether each\nincoming email is ham or spam, and simultaneously predicts whether it is an urgent\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\nor non-urgent email. In this case, you would need two output neurons, both using\nthe logistic activation function: the first would output the probability that the email is\nspam and the second would output the probability that it is urgent. More generally,\nyou would dedicate one output neuron for each positive class. Note that the output\nprobabilities do not necessarily add up to one. This lets the model output any combi\u2010\nnation of labels: you can have non-urgent ham, urgent ham, non-urgent spam, and\nperhaps even urgent spam (although that would probably be an error).\nIf each instance can belong only to a single class, out of 3 or more possible classes\n(e.g., classes 0 through 9 for digit image classification), then you need to have one\noutput neuron per class, and you should use the softmax activation function for the\nwhole output layer (see Figure 10-9). The softmax function (introduced in Chapter 4)\nwill ensure that all the estimated probabilities are between 0 and 1 and that they add\nup to one (which is required if the classes are exclusive). This is called multiclass clas\u2010\nsification.\nFigure 10-9. A modern MLP (including ReLU and softmax) for classification\nRegarding the loss function, since we are predicting probability distributions, the\ncross-entropy (also called the log loss, see Chapter 4) is generally a good choice.\nTable 10-2 summarizes the typical architecture of a classification MLP.\nTable 10-2.

Its documentation (or specification) is avail\u2010\nable at https://keras.io. The reference implementation is simply called Keras as well, so\nto avoid any confusion we will call it keras-team (since it is available at https://\ngithub.com/keras-team/keras). It was developed by Fran\u00e7ois Chollet as part of a\nresearch project12 and released as an open source project in March 2015. It quickly\ngained popularity owing to its ease-of-use, flexibility and beautiful design. To per\u2010\nform the heavy computations required by neural networks, keras-team relies on a\ncomputation backend. At the present, you can choose from three popular open\nsource deep learning libraries: TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) or\nTheano.\nMoreover, since late 2016, other implementations have been released. You can now\nrun Keras on Apache MXNet, Apple\u2019s Core ML, Javascript or Typescript (to run Keras\ncode in a web browser), or PlaidML (which can run on all sorts of GPU devices, not\njust Nvidia). Moreover, TensorFlow itself now comes bundled with its own Keras\nimplementation called tf.keras. It only supports TensorFlow as the backend, but it has\nthe advantage of offering some very useful extra features (see Figure 10-10): for\nexample, it supports TensorFlow\u2019s Data API which makes it quite easy to load and\npreprocess data efficiently. For this reason, we will use tf.keras in this book. However,\nin this chapter we will not use any of the TensorFlow-specific features, so the code\nshould run fine on other Keras implementations as well (at least in Python), with only\nminor modifications, such as changing the imports.\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\nFigure 10-10. Two Keras implementations: keras-team (left) and tf.keras (right)\nAs tf.keras is bundled with TensorFlow, let\u2019s install TensorFlow!\nImplementing MLPs with Keras\n|\nThe second version is the version of the Keras API implemented by tf.keras. Note that\nit ends with -tf, highlighting the fact that tf.keras implements the Keras API, plus\nsome extra TensorFlow-specific features.\nNow let\u2019s use tf.keras! Let\u2019s start by building a simple image classifier.\nImplementing MLPs with Keras\n|\ntor of bias terms (one per neuron). When it receives some input data, it computes\nEquation 10-2.\n\u2022 Next we add a second Dense hidden layer with 100 neurons, also using the ReLU\nactivation function.\n\u2022 Finally, we add a Dense output layer with 10 neurons (one per class), using the\nsoftmax activation function (because the classes are exclusive).\nSpecifying\nactivation=\"relu\"\nis\nequivalent\nto\nactiva\ntion=keras.activations.relu. Other activation functions are\navailable in the keras.activations package, we will use many of\nthem in this book. See https://keras.io/activations/ for the full list.\nInstead of adding the layers one by one as we just did, you can pass a list of layers\nwhen creating the Sequential model:\nmodel = keras.models.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=[28, 28]),\nkeras.layers.Dense(300, activation=\"relu\"),\nkeras.layers.Dense(100, activation=\"relu\"),\nkeras.layers.Dense(10, activation=\"softmax\")\n])\nUsing Code Examples From keras.io\nCode examples documented on keras.io will work fine with tf.keras, but you need to\nchange the imports. For example, consider this keras.io code:\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\noutput_layer = Dense(10)\nYou must change the imports like this:\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense\noutput_layer = Dense(10)\nOr simply use full paths, if you prefer:\nfrom tensorflow import keras\noutput_layer = keras.layers.Dense(10)\nThis is more verbose, but I use this approach in this book so you can easily see which\npackages to use, and to avoid confusion between standard classes and custom classes.\nIn production code, I use the previous approach, as do most people.\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\n13 You can also generate an image of your model using keras.utils.plot_model().\nThe model\u2019s summary() method displays all the model\u2019s layers13, including each layer\u2019s\nname (which is automatically generated unless you set it when creating the layer), its\noutput shape (None means the batch size can be anything), and its number of parame\u2010\nters. The summary ends with the total number of parameters, including trainable and\nnon-trainable parameters. Here we only have trainable parameters (we will see exam\u2010\nples of non-trainable parameters in Chapter 11):\n>>> model.summary()\n_________________________________________________________________\nLayer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #\n=================================================================\nflatten_1 (Flatten)          (None, 784)               0\n_________________________________________________________________\ndense_3 (Dense)              (None, 300)               235500\n_________________________________________________________________\ndense_4 (Dense)              (None, 100)               30100\n_________________________________________________________________\ndense_5 (Dense)              (None, 10)                1010\n=================================================================\nTotal params: 266,610\nTrainable params: 266,610\nNon-trainable params: 0\nNote that Dense layers often have a lot of parameters. For example, the first hidden\nlayer has 784 \u00d7 300 connection weights, plus 300 bias terms, which adds up to\n235,500 parameters! This gives the model quite a lot of flexibility to fit the training\ndata, but it also means that the model runs the risk of overfitting, especially when you\ndo not have a lot of training data. We will come back to this later.\nYou can easily get a model\u2019s list of layers, to fetch a layer by its index, or you can fetch\nit by name:\n>>> model.layers\n[<tensorflow.python.keras.layers.core.Flatten at 0x132414e48>,\n<tensorflow.python.keras.layers.core.Dense at 0x1324149b0>,\n<tensorflow.python.keras.layers.core.Dense at 0x1356ba8d0>,\n<tensorflow.python.keras.layers.core.Dense at 0x13240d240>]\n>>> model.layers[1].name\n'dense_3'\n>>> model.get_layer('dense_3').name\n'dense_3'\nAll the parameters of a layer can be accessed using its get_weights() and\nset_weights() method. For a Dense layer, this includes both the connection weights\nand the bias terms:\nImplementing MLPs with Keras\n|\n>>> weights, biases = hidden1.get_weights()\n>>> weights\narray([[ 0.03854964, -0.04054524,  0.00599282, ...,  0.02566582,\n0.01032123,  0.06914985],\n...,\n[ 0.02632413, -0.05105981, -0.00332005, ...,  0.04175945,\n0.0443138 , -0.05558084]], dtype=float32)\n>>> weights.shape\n(784, 300)\n>>> biases\narray([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., ...,  0., 0., 0.], dtype=float32)\n>>> biases.shape\n(300,)\nNotice that the Dense layer initialized the connection weights randomly (which is\nneeded to break symmetry, as we discussed earlier), and the biases were just initial\u2010\nized to zeros, which is fine. If you ever want to use a different initialization method,\nyou can set kernel_initializer (kernel is another name for the matrix of connec\u2010\ntion weights) or bias_initializer when creating the layer. We will discuss initializ\u2010\ners further in Chapter 11, but if you want the full list, see https://keras.io/initializers/.\nThe shape of the weight matrix depends on the number of inputs.\nThis is why it is recommended to specify the input_shape when\ncreating the first layer in a Sequential model. However, if you do\nnot specify the input shape, it\u2019s okay: Keras will simply wait until it\nknows the input shape before it actually builds the model. This will\nhappen either when you feed it actual data (e.g., during training),\nor when you call its build() method. Until the model is really\nbuilt, the layers will not have any weights, and you will not be able\nto do certain things (such as print the model summary or save the\nmodel), so if you know the input shape when creating the model, it\nis best to specify it.\nCompiling the Model\nAfter a model is created, you must call its compile() method to specify the loss func\u2010\ntion and the optimizer to use. Optionally, you can also specify a list of extra metrics to\ncompute during training and evaluation:\nmodel.compile(loss=\"sparse_categorical_crossentropy\",\noptimizer=\"sgd\",\nmetrics=[\"accuracy\"])\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\nUsing loss=\"sparse_categorical_crossentropy\" is equivalent to\nloss=keras.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy.\nSimi\u2010\nlarly, optimizer=\"sgd\" is equivalent to optimizer=keras.optimiz\ners.SGD()\nImplementing MLPs with Keras\n|\nmodel is probably overfitting the training set (or there is a bug, such as a data mis\u2010\nmatch between the training set and the validation set):\n>>> history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=30,\n...                     validation_data=(X_valid, y_valid))\n...\nTrain on 55000 samples, validate on 5000 samples\nEpoch 1/30\n55000/55000 [==========] - 3s 55us/sample - loss: 1.4948     - acc: 0.5757\n- val_loss: 1.0042 - val_acc: 0.7166\nEpoch 2/30\n55000/55000 [==========] - 3s 55us/sample - loss: 0.8690     - acc: 0.7318\n- val_loss: 0.7549 - val_acc: 0.7616\n[...]\nEpoch 50/50\n55000/55000 [==========] - 4s 72us/sample - loss: 0.3607     - acc: 0.8752\n- val_loss: 0.3706 - val_acc: 0.8728\nAnd that\u2019s it! The neural network is trained. At each epoch during training, Keras dis\u2010\nplays the number of instances processed so far (along with a progress bar), the mean\ntraining time per sample, the loss and accuracy (or any other extra metrics you asked\nfor), both on the training set and the validation set. You can see that the training loss\nwent down, which is a good sign, and the validation accuracy reached 87.28% after 50\nepochs, not too far from the training accuracy, so there does not seem to be much\noverfitting going on.\nInstead of passing a validation set using the validation_data\nargument, you could instead set validation_split to the ratio of\nthe training set that you want Keras to use for validation (e.g., 0.1).\nIf the training set was very skewed, with some classes being overrepresented and oth\u2010\ners underrepresented, it would be useful to set the class_weight argument when\ncalling the fit() method, giving a larger weight to underrepresented classes, and a\nlower weight to overrepresented classes. These weights would be used by Keras when\ncomputing the loss. If you need per-instance weights instead, you can set the sam\nple_weight argument (it supersedes class_weight). This could be useful for exam\u2010\nple if some instances were labeled by experts while others were labeled using a\ncrowdsourcing platform: you might want to give more weight to the former. You can\nalso provide sample weights (but not class weights) for the validation set by adding\nthem as a third item in the validation_data tuple.\nThe fit() method returns a History object containing the training parameters (his\ntory.params), the list of epochs it went through (history.epoch), and most impor\u2010\ntantly a dictionary (history.history) containing the loss and extra metrics it\nmeasured at the end of each epoch on the training set and on the validation set (if\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\nany). If you create a Pandas DataFrame using this dictionary and call its plot()\nmethod, you get the learning curves shown in Figure 10-12:\nimport pandas as pd\npd.DataFrame(history.history).plot(figsize=(8, 5))\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.gca().set_ylim(0, 1) # set the vertical range to [0-1]\nplt.show()\nFigure 10-12. Learning Curves\nYou can see that both the training and validation accuracy steadily increase during\ntraining, while the training and validation loss decrease. Good! Moreover, the valida\u2010\ntion curves are quite close to the training curves, which means that there is not too\nmuch overfitting. In this particular case, the model performed better on the valida\u2010\ntion set than on the training set at the beginning of training: this sometimes happens\nby chance (especially when the validation set is fairly small). However, the training set\nperformance ends up beating the validation performance, as is generally the case\nwhen you train for long enough. You can tell that the model has not quite converged\nyet, as the validation loss is still going down, so you should probably continue train\u2010\ning. It\u2019s as simple as calling the fit() method again, since Keras just continues train\u2010\ning where it left off (you should be able to reach close to 89% validation accuracy).\nIf you are not satisfied with the performance of your model, you should go back and\ntune the model\u2019s hyperparameters, for example the number of layers, the number of\nneurons per layer, the types of activation functions we use for each hidden layer, the\nImplementing MLPs with Keras\n|\nnumber of training epochs, the batch size (it can be set in the fit() method using the\nbatch_size argument, which defaults to 32). We will get back to hyperparameter\ntuning at the end of this chapter. Once you are satisfied with your model\u2019s validation\naccuracy, you should evaluate it on the test set to estimate the generalization error\nbefore you deploy the model to production. You can easily do this using the evalu\nate() method (it also supports several other arguments, such as batch_size or sam\nple_weight, please check the documentation for more details):\n>>> model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)\n8832/10000 [==========================] - ETA: 0s - loss: 0.4074 - acc: 0.8540\n[0.40738476498126985, 0.854]\nAs we saw in Chapter 2, it is common to get slightly lower performance on the test set\nthan on the validation set, because the hyperparameters are tuned on the validation\nset, not the test set (however, in this example, we did not do any hyperparameter tun\u2010\ning, so the lower accuracy is just bad luck). Remember to resist the temptation to\ntweak the hyperparameters on the test set, or else your estimate of the generalization\nerror will be too optimistic.\nUsing the Model to Make Predictions\nNext, we can use the model\u2019s predict() method to make predictions on new instan\u2010\nces. Since we don\u2019t have actual new instances, we will just use the first 3 instances of\nthe test set:\n>>> X_new = X_test[:3]\n>>> y_proba = model.predict(X_new)\n>>> y_proba.round(2)\narray([[0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.09, 0.  , 0.12, 0.  , 0.79],\n[0.  , 0.  , 0.94, 0.  , 0.02, 0.  , 0.04, 0.  , 0.  , 0.  ],\n[0.  , 1.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  ]],\ndtype=float32)\nAs you can see, for each instance the model estimates one probability per class, from\nclass 0 to class 9. For example, for the first image it estimates that the probability of\nclass 9 (ankle boot) is 79%, the probability of class 7 (sneaker) is 12%, the probability\nof class 5 (sandal) is 9%, and the other classes are negligible. In other words, it\n\u201cbelieves\u201d it\u2019s footwear, probably ankle boots, but it\u2019s not entirely sure, it might be\nsneakers or sandals instead. If you only care about the class with the highest estima\u2010\nted probability (even if that probability is quite low) then you can use the pre\ndict_classes() method instead:\n>>> y_pred = model.predict_classes(X_new)\n>>> y_pred\narray([9, 2, 1])\n>>> np.array(class_names)[y_pred]\narray(['Ankle boot', 'Pullover', 'Trouser'], dtype='<U11')\nAnd the classifier actually classified all three images correctly:\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\n>>> y_new = y_test[:3]\n>>> y_new\narray([9, 2, 1])\nNow you know how to build, train, evaluate and use a classification MLP using the\nSequential API. But what about regression?\nImplementing MLPs with Keras\n|\n14 \u201cWide & Deep Learning for Recommender Systems,\u201d Heng-Tze Cheng et al. (2016).\nAs you can see, the Sequential API is quite easy to use. However, although sequential\nmodels are extremely common, it is sometimes useful to build neural networks with\nmore complex topologies, or with multiple inputs or outputs. For this purpose, Keras\noffers the Functional API.\nImplementing MLPs with Keras\n|\ning Keras how it should connect the layers together, no actual data is being pro\u2010\ncessed yet.\n\u2022 We then create a second hidden layer, and again we use it as a function. Note\nhowever that we pass it the output of the first hidden layer.\n\u2022 Next, we create a Concatenate() layer, and once again we immediately use it like\na function, to concatenate the input and the output of the second hidden layer\n(you may prefer the keras.layers.concatenate() function, which creates a Con\ncatenate layer and immediately calls it with the given inputs).\n\u2022 Then we create the output layer, with a single neuron and no activation function,\nand we call it like a function, passing it the result of the concatenation.\n\u2022 Lastly, we create a Keras Model, specifying which inputs and outputs to use.\nOnce you have built the Keras model, everything is exactly like earlier, so no need to\nrepeat it here: you must compile the model, train it, evaluate it and use it to make\npredictions.\nBut what if you want to send a subset of the features through the wide path, and a\ndifferent subset (possibly overlapping) through the deep path (see Figure 10-14)? In\nthis case, one solution is to use multiple inputs. For example, suppose we want to\nsend 5 features through the deep path (features 0 to 4), and 6 features through the\nwide path (features 2 to 7):\ninput_A = keras.layers.Input(shape=[5])\ninput_B = keras.layers.Input(shape=[6])\nhidden1 = keras.layers.Dense(30, activation=\"relu\")(input_B)\nhidden2 = keras.layers.Dense(30, activation=\"relu\")(hidden1)\nconcat = keras.layers.concatenate([input_A, hidden2])\noutput = keras.layers.Dense(1)(concat)\nmodel = keras.models.Model(inputs=[input_A, input_B], outputs=[output])\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\nFigure 10-14. Handling Multiple Inputs\nThe code is self-explanatory. Note that we specified inputs=[input_A, input_B]\nwhen creating the model. Now we can compile the model as usual, but when we call\nthe fit() method, instead of passing a single input matrix X_train, we must pass a\npair of matrices (X_train_A, X_train_B): one per input. The same is true for\nX_valid, and also for X_test and X_new when you call evaluate() or predict():\nmodel.compile(loss=\"mse\", optimizer=\"sgd\")\nX_train_A, X_train_B = X_train[:, :5], X_train[:, 2:]\nX_valid_A, X_valid_B = X_valid[:, :5], X_valid[:, 2:]\nX_test_A, X_test_B = X_test[:, :5], X_test[:, 2:]\nX_new_A, X_new_B = X_test_A[:3], X_test_B[:3]\nhistory = model.fit((X_train_A, X_train_B), y_train, epochs=20,\nvalidation_data=((X_valid_A, X_valid_B), y_valid))\nmse_test = model.evaluate((X_test_A, X_test_B), y_test)\ny_pred = model.predict((X_new_A, X_new_B))\nImplementing MLPs with Keras\n|\nThere are also many use cases in which you may want to have multiple outputs:\n\u2022 The task may demand it, for example you may want to locate and classify the\nmain object in a picture. This is both a regression task (finding the coordinates of\nthe object\u2019s center, as well as its width and height) and a classification task.\n\u2022 Similarly, you may have multiple independent tasks to perform based on the\nsame data. Sure, you could train one neural network per task, but in many cases\nyou will get better results on all tasks by training a single neural network with\none output per task. This is because the neural network can learn features in the\ndata that are useful across tasks.\n\u2022 Another use case is as a regularization technique (i.e., a training constraint whose\nobjective is to reduce overfitting and thus improve the model\u2019s ability to general\u2010\nize). For example, you may want to add some auxiliary outputs in a neural net\u2010\nwork architecture (see Figure 10-15) to ensure that the underlying part of the\nnetwork learns something useful on its own, without relying on the rest of the\nnetwork.\nFigure 10-15. Handling Multiple Outputs \u2013 Auxiliary Output for Regularization\nAdding extra outputs is quite easy: just connect them to the appropriate layers and\nadd them to your model\u2019s list of outputs. For example, the following code builds the\nnetwork represented in Figure 10-15:\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\n[...] # Same as above, up to the main output layer\noutput = keras.layers.Dense(1)(concat)\naux_output = keras.layers.Dense(1)(hidden2)\nmodel = keras.models.Model(inputs=[input_A, input_B],\noutputs=[output, aux_output])\nEach output will need its own loss function, so when we compile the model we\nshould pass a list of losses (if we pass a single loss, Keras will assume that the same\nloss must be used for all outputs). By default, Keras will compute all these losses and\nsimply add them up to get the final loss used for training. However, we care much\nmore about the main output than about the auxiliary output (as it is just used for reg\u2010\nularization), so we want to give the main output\u2019s loss a much greater weight. Fortu\u2010\nnately, it is possible to set all the loss weights when compiling the model:\nmodel.compile(loss=[\"mse\", \"mse\"], loss_weights=[0.9, 0.1], optimizer=\"sgd\")\nNow when we train the model, we need to provide some labels for each output. In\nthis example, the main output and the auxiliary output should try to predict the same\nthing, so they should use the same labels. So instead of passing y_train, we just need\nto pass (y_train, y_train) (and the same goes for y_valid and y_test):\nhistory = model.fit(\n[X_train_A, X_train_B], [y_train, y_train], epochs=20,\nvalidation_data=([X_valid_A, X_valid_B], [y_valid, y_valid]))\nWhen we evaluate the model, Keras will return the total loss, as well as all the individ\u2010\nual losses:\ntotal_loss, main_loss, aux_loss = model.evaluate(\n[X_test_A, X_test_B], [y_test, y_test])\nSimilarly, the predict() method will return predictions for each output:\ny_pred_main, y_pred_aux = model.predict([X_new_A, X_new_B])\nAs you can see, you can build any sort of architecture you want quite easily with the\nFunctional API. Let\u2019s look at one last way you can build Keras models.\nImplementing MLPs with Keras\n|\n15 Keras models have an output attribute, so we cannot use that name for the main output layer, which is why\nwe renamed it to main_output.\nSimply subclass the Model class, create the layers you need in the constructor, and use\nthem to perform the computations you want in the call() method. For example, cre\u2010\nating an instance of the following WideAndDeepModel class gives us an equivalent\nmodel to the one we just built with the Functional API. You can then compile it, eval\u2010\nuate it and use it to make predictions, exactly like we just did.\nclass WideAndDeepModel(keras.models.Model):\ndef __init__(self, units=30, activation=\"relu\", **kwargs):\nsuper().__init__(**kwargs) # handles standard args (e.g., name)\nself.hidden1 = keras.layers.Dense(units, activation=activation)\nself.hidden2 = keras.layers.Dense(units, activation=activation)\nself.main_output = keras.layers.Dense(1)\nself.aux_output = keras.layers.Dense(1)\ndef call(self, inputs):\ninput_A, input_B = inputs\nhidden1 = self.hidden1(input_B)\nhidden2 = self.hidden2(hidden1)\nconcat = keras.layers.concatenate([input_A, hidden2])\nmain_output = self.main_output(concat)\naux_output = self.aux_output(hidden2)\nreturn main_output, aux_output\nmodel = WideAndDeepModel()\nThis example looks very much like the Functional API, except we do not need to cre\u2010\nate the inputs, we just use the input argument to the call() method, and we separate\nthe creation of the layers15 in the constructor from their usage in the call() method.\nHowever, the big difference is that you can do pretty much anything you want in the\ncall() method: for loops, if statements, low-level TensorFlow operations, your\nimagination is the limit (see Chapter 12)! This makes it a great API for researchers\nexperimenting with new ideas.\nHowever, this extra flexibility comes at a cost: your model\u2019s architecture is hidden\nwithin the call() method, so Keras cannot easily inspect it, it cannot save or clone it,\nand when you call the summary() method, you only get a list of layers, without any\ninformation on how they are connected to each other. Moreover, Keras cannot check\ntypes and shapes ahead of time, and it is easier to make mistakes. So unless you really\nneed that extra flexibility, you should probably stick to the Sequential API or the\nFunctional API.\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\nKeras models can be used just like regular layers, so you can easily\ncompose them to build complex architectures.\nNow that you know how to build and train neural nets using Keras, you will want to\nsave them!\nImplementing MLPs with Keras\n|\n[...] # build and compile the model\ncheckpoint_cb = keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(\"my_keras_model.h5\")\nhistory = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[checkpoint_cb])\nMoreover, if you use a validation set during training, you can set\nsave_best_only=True when creating the ModelCheckpoint. In this case, it will only\nsave your model when its performance on the validation set is the best so far. This\nway, you do not need to worry about training for too long and overfitting the training\nset: simply restore the last model saved after training, and this will be the best model\non the validation set. This is a simple way to implement early stopping (introduced in\nChapter 4):\ncheckpoint_cb = keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(\"my_keras_model.h5\",\nsave_best_only=True)\nhistory = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10,\nvalidation_data=(X_valid, y_valid),\ncallbacks=[checkpoint_cb])\nmodel = keras.models.load_model(\"my_keras_model.h5\") # rollback to best model\nAnother way to implement early stopping is to simply use the EarlyStopping call\u2010\nback. It will interrupt training when it measures no progress on the validation set for\na number of epochs (defined by the patience argument), and it will optionally roll\nback to the best model. You can combine both callbacks to both save checkpoints of\nyour model (in case your computer crashes), and actually interrupt training early\nwhen there is no more progress (to avoid wasting time and resources):\nearly_stopping_cb = keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(patience=10,\nrestore_best_weights=True)\nhistory = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100,\nvalidation_data=(X_valid, y_valid),\ncallbacks=[checkpoint_cb, early_stopping_cb])\nThe number of epochs can be set to a large value since training will stop automati\u2010\ncally when there is no more progress. Moreover, there is no need to restore the best\nmodel saved in this case since the EarlyStopping callback will keep track of the best\nweights and restore them for us at the end of training.\nThere are many other callbacks available in the keras.callbacks\npackage. See https://keras.io/callbacks/.\nIf you need extra control, you can easily write your own custom callbacks. For exam\u2010\nple, the following custom callback will display the ratio between the validation loss\nand the training loss during training (e.g., to detect overfitting):\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\nclass PrintValTrainRatioCallback(keras.callbacks.Callback):\ndef on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs):\nprint(\"\\nval/train: {:.2f}\".format(logs[\"val_loss\"] / logs[\"loss\"]))\nAs you might expect, you can implement on_train_begin(), on_train_end(),\non_epoch_begin(), on_epoch_begin(), on_batch_end() and on_batch_end().\nMoreover, callbacks can also be used during evaluation and predictions, should you\never need them (e.g., for debugging). In this case, you should implement\non_test_begin(),\non_test_end(),\non_test_batch_begin(),\nor\non_test_batch_end() (called by evaluate()), or on_predict_begin(), on_pre\ndict_end(), on_predict_batch_begin(), or on_predict_batch_end() (called by\npredict()).\nNow let\u2019s take a look at one more tool you should definitely have in your toolbox\nwhen using tf.keras: TensorBoard.\nImplementing MLPs with Keras\n|\nrun_logdir = get_run_logdir() # e.g., './my_logs/run_2019_01_16-11_28_43'\nNext, the good news is that Keras provides a nice TensorBoard callback:\n[...] # Build and compile your model\ntensorboard_cb = keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(run_logdir)\nhistory = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=30,\nvalidation_data=(X_valid, y_valid),\ncallbacks=[tensorboard_cb])\nAnd that\u2019s all there is to it! It could hardly be easier to use. If you run this code, the\nTensorBoard callback will take care of creating the log directory for you (along with\nits parent directories if needed), and during training it will create event files and write\nsummaries to them. After running the program a second time (perhaps changing\nsome hyperparameter value), you will end up with a directory structure similar to\nthis one:\nmy_logs\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 run_2019_01_16-16_51_02\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 events.out.tfevents.1547628669.mycomputer.local.v2\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 run_2019_01_16-16_56_50\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 events.out.tfevents.1547629020.mycomputer.local.v2\nNext you need to start the TensorBoard server. If you installed TensorFlow within a\nvirtualenv, you should activate it. Next, run the following command at the root of the\nproject (or from anywhere else as long as you point to the appropriate log directory).\nIf your shell cannot find the tensorboard script, then you must update your PATH\nenvironment variable so that it contains the directory in which the script was\ninstalled (alternatively, you can just replace tensorboard with python3 -m tensor\nboard.main).\n$ tensorboard --logdir=./my_logs --port=6006\nTensorBoard 2.0.0 at http://mycomputer.local:6006 (Press CTRL+C to quit)\nFinally, open up a web browser to http://localhost:6006. You should see TensorBoard\u2019s\nweb interface. Click on the SCALARS tab to view the learning curves (see\nFigure 10-16). Notice that the training loss went down nicely during both runs, but\nthe second run went down much faster. Indeed, we used a larger learning rate by set\u2010\nting optimizer=keras.optimizers.SGD(lr=0.05) instead of optimizer=\"sgd\",\nwhich defaults to a learning rate of 0.001.\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\nFigure 10-16. Visualizing Learning Curves with TensorBoard\nUnfortunately, at the time of writing, no other data is exported by the TensorBoard\ncallback, but this issue will probably be fixed by the time you read these lines. In Ten\u2010\nsorFlow 1, this callback exported the computation graph and many useful statistics:\ntype help(keras.callbacks.TensorBoard) to see all the options.\nLet\u2019s summarize what you learned so far in this chapter: we saw where neural nets\ncame from, what an MLP is and how you can use it for classification and regression,\nhow to build MLPs using tf.keras\u2019s Sequential API, or more complex architectures\nusing the Functional API or Model Subclassing, you learned how to save and restore a\nmodel, use callbacks for checkpointing, early stopping, and more, and finally how to\nuse TensorBoard for visualization. You can already go ahead and use neural networks\nto tackle many problems!

We will tackle Fashion MNIST, which is a drop-in\nreplacement of MNIST (introduced in Chapter 3). It has the exact same format as\nMNIST (70,000 grayscale images of 28\u00d728 pixels each, with 10 classes), but the\nimages represent fashion items rather than handwritten digits, so each class is more\ndiverse and the problem turns out to be significantly more challenging than MNIST.\nFor example, a simple linear model reaches about 92% accuracy on MNIST, but only\nabout 83% on Fashion MNIST.\nUsing Keras to Load the Dataset\nKeras provides some utility functions to fetch and load common datasets, including\nMNIST, Fashion MNIST, the original California housing dataset, and more. Let\u2019s load\nFashion MNIST:\nfashion_mnist = keras.datasets.fashion_mnist\n(X_train_full, y_train_full), (X_test, y_test) = fashion_mnist.load_data()\nWhen loading MNIST or Fashion MNIST using Keras rather than Scikit-Learn, one\nimportant difference is that every image is represented as a 28\u00d728 array rather than a\n1D array of size 784. Moreover, the pixel intensities are represented as integers (from\n0 to 255) rather than floats (from 0.0 to 255.0). Here is the shape and data type of the\ntraining set:\n>>> X_train_full.shape\n(60000, 28, 28)\n>>> X_train_full.dtype\ndtype('uint8')\nNote that the dataset is already split into a training set and a test set, but there is no\nvalidation set, so let\u2019s create one. Moreover, since we are going to train the neural net\u2010\nwork using Gradient Descent, we must scale the input features. For simplicity, we just\nscale the pixel intensities down to the 0-1 range by dividing them by 255.0 (this also\nconverts them to floats):\nX_valid, X_train = X_train_full[:5000] / 255.0, X_train_full[5000:] / 255.0\ny_valid, y_train = y_train_full[:5000], y_train_full[5000:]\nWith MNIST, when the label is equal to 5, it means that the image represents the\nhandwritten digit 5. Easy. However, for Fashion MNIST, we need the list of class\nnames to know what we are dealing with:\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\nclass_names = [\"T-shirt/top\", \"Trouser\", \"Pullover\", \"Dress\", \"Coat\",\n\"Sandal\", \"Shirt\", \"Sneaker\", \"Bag\", \"Ankle boot\"]\nFor example, the first image in the training set represents a coat:\n>>> class_names[y_train[0]]\n'Coat'\nFigure 10-11 shows a few samples from the Fashion MNIST dataset:\nFigure 10-11. Samples from Fashion MNIST\nCreating the Model Using the Sequential API\nNow let\u2019s build the neural network! Here is a classification MLP with two hidden lay\u2010\ners:\nmodel = keras.models.Sequential()\nmodel.add(keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=[28, 28]))\nmodel.add(keras.layers.Dense(300, activation=\"relu\"))\nmodel.add(keras.layers.Dense(100, activation=\"relu\"))\nmodel.add(keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=\"softmax\"))\nLet\u2019s go through this code line by line:\n\u2022 The first line creates a Sequential model. This is the simplest kind of Keras\nmodel, for neural networks that are just composed of a single stack of layers, con\u2010\nnected sequentially. This is called the sequential API.\n\u2022 Next, we build the first layer and add it to the model. It is a Flatten layer whose\nrole is simply to convert each input image into a 1D array: if it receives input data\nX, it computes X.reshape(-1, 1). This layer does not have any parameters, it is\njust there to do some simple preprocessing. Since it is the first layer in the model,\nyou should specify the input_shape: this does not include the batch size, only the\nshape of the instances. Alternatively, you could add a keras.layers.InputLayer\nas the first layer, setting shape=[28,28].\n\u2022 Next we add a Dense hidden layer with 300 neurons. It will use the ReLU activa\u2010\ntion function. Each Dense layer manages its own weight matrix, containing all the\nconnection weights between the neurons and their inputs. It also manages a vec\u2010",

Not only can you use any imaginable network architec\u2010\nture, but even in a simple MLP you can change the number of layers, the number of\nneurons per layer, the type of activation function to use in each layer, the weight initi\u2010\nFine-Tuning Neural Network Hyperparameters\n|\nalization logic, and much more. How do you know what combination of hyperpara\u2010\nmeters is the best for your task?\nOne option is to simply try many combinations of hyperparameters and see which\none works best on the validation set (or using K-fold cross-validation). For this, one\napproach is simply use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to explore the hyper\u2010\nparameter space, as we did in Chapter 2. For this, we need to wrap our Keras models\nin objects that mimic regular Scikit-Learn regressors. The first step is to create a func\u2010\ntion that will build and compile a Keras model, given a set of hyperparameters:\ndef build_model(n_hidden=1, n_neurons=30, learning_rate=3e-3, input_shape=[8]):\nmodel = keras.models.Sequential()\noptions = {\"input_shape\": input_shape}\nfor layer in range(n_hidden):\nmodel.add(keras.layers.Dense(n_neurons, activation=\"relu\", **options))\noptions = {}\nmodel.add(keras.layers.Dense(1, **options))\noptimizer = keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate)\nmodel.compile(loss=\"mse\", optimizer=optimizer)\nreturn model\nThis function creates a simple Sequential model for univariate regression (only one\noutput neuron), with the given input shape and the given number of hidden layers\nand neurons, and it compiles it using an SGD optimizer configured with the given\nlearning rate. The options dict is used to ensure that the first layer is properly given\nthe input shape (note that if n_hidden=0, the first layer will be the output layer). It is\ngood practice to provide reasonable defaults to as many hyperparameters as you can,\nas Scikit-Learn does.\nNext, let\u2019s create a KerasRegressor based on this build_model() function:\nkeras_reg = keras.wrappers.scikit_learn.KerasRegressor(build_model)\nThe KerasRegressor object is a thin wrapper around the Keras model built using\nbuild_model(). Since we did not specify any hyperparameter when creating it, it will\njust use the default hyperparameters we defined in build_model(). Now we can use\nthis object like a regular Scikit-Learn regressor: we can train it using its fit()\nmethod, then evaluate it using its score() method, and use it to make predictions\nusing its predict() method. Note that any extra parameter you pass to the fit()\nmethod will simply get passed to the underlying Keras model. Also note that the\nscore will be the opposite of the MSE because Scikit-Learn wants scores, not losses\n(i.e., higher should be better).\nkeras_reg.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100,\nvalidation_data=(X_valid, y_valid),\ncallbacks=[keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(patience=10)])\nmse_test = keras_reg.score(X_test, y_test)\ny_pred = keras_reg.predict(X_new)\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\nHowever, we do not actually want to train and evaluate a single model like this, we\nwant to train hundreds of variants and see which one performs best on the validation\nset. Since there are many hyperparameters, it is preferable to use a randomized search\nrather than grid search (as we discussed in Chapter 2). Let\u2019s try to explore the number\nof hidden layers, the number of neurons and the learning rate:\nfrom scipy.stats import reciprocal\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV\nparam_distribs = {\n\"n_hidden\": [0, 1, 2, 3],\n\"n_neurons\": np.arange(1, 100),\n\"learning_rate\": reciprocal(3e-4, 3e-2),\n}\nrnd_search_cv = RandomizedSearchCV(keras_reg, param_distribs, n_iter=10, cv=3)\nrnd_search_cv.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100,\nvalidation_data=(X_valid, y_valid),\ncallbacks=[keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(patience=10)])\nAs you can see, this is identical to what we did in Chapter 2, with the exception that\nwe pass extra parameters to the fit() method: they simply get relayed to the under\u2010\nlying Keras models. Note that RandomizedSearchCV uses K-fold cross-validation, so it\ndoes not use X_valid and y_valid. These are just used for early stopping.\nThe exploration may last many hours depending on the hardware, the size of the\ndataset, the complexity of the model and the value of n_iter and cv. When it is over,\nyou can access the best parameters found, the best score, and the trained Keras model\nlike this:\n>>> rnd_search_cv.best_params_\n{'learning_rate': 0.0033625641252688094, 'n_hidden': 2, 'n_neurons': 42}\n>>> rnd_search_cv.best_score_\n-0.3189529188278931\n>>> model = rnd_search_cv.best_estimator_.model\nYou can now save this model, evaluate it on the test set, and if you are satisfied with\nits performance, deploy it to production. Using randomized search is not too hard,\nand it works well for many fairly simple problems. However, when training is slow\n(e.g., for more complex problems with larger datasets), this approach will only\nexplore a tiny portion of the hyperparameter space. You can partially alleviate this\nproblem by assisting the search process manually: first run a quick random search\nusing wide ranges of hyperparameter values, then run another search using smaller\nranges of values centered on the best ones found during the first run, and so on. This\nwill hopefully zoom in to a good set of hyperparameters. However, this is very time\nconsuming, and probably not the best use of your time.\nFortunately, there are many techniques to explore a search space much more effi\u2010\nciently than randomly. Their core idea is simple: when a region of the space turns out\nFine-Tuning Neural Network Hyperparameters\n|\n16 \u201cPopulation Based Training of Neural Networks,\u201d Max Jaderberg et al. (2017).\nto be good, it should be explored more. This takes care of the \u201czooming\u201d process for\nyou and leads to much better solutions in much less time. Here are a few Python\nlibraries you can use to optimize hyperparameters:\n\u2022 Hyperopt: a popular Python library for optimizing over all sorts of complex\nsearch spaces (including real values such as the learning rate, or discrete values\nsuch as the number of layers).\n\u2022 Hyperas, kopt or Talos: optimizing hyperparameters for Keras model (the first\ntwo are based on Hyperopt).\n\u2022 Scikit-Optimize (skopt): a general-purpose optimization library. The Bayes\nSearchCV class performs Bayesian optimization using an interface similar to Grid\nSearchCV.\n\u2022 Spearmint: a Bayesian optimization library.\n\u2022 Sklearn-Deap: a hyperparameter optimization library based on evolutionary\nalgorithms, also with a GridSearchCV-like interface.\n\u2022 And many more!\nMoreover, many companies offer services for hyperparameter optimization. For\nexample Google Cloud ML Engine has a hyperparameter tuning service. Other com\u2010\npanies provide APIs for hyperparameter optimization, such as Arimo, SigOpt, Oscar\nand many more.\nHyperparameter tuning is still an active area of research. Evolutionary algorithms are\nmaking a comeback lately. For example, check out DeepMind\u2019s excellent 2017 paper16,\nwhere they jointly optimize a population of models and their hyperparameters. Goo\u2010\ngle also used an evolutionary approach, not just to search for hyperparameters, but\nalso to look for the best neural network architecture for the problem. They call this\nAutoML, and it is already available as a cloud service. Perhaps the days of building\nneural networks manually will soon be over? Check out Google\u2019s post on this topic. In\nfact, evolutionary algorithms have also been used successfully to train individual neu\u2010\nral networks, replacing the ubiquitous Gradient Descent! See this 2017 post by Uber\nwhere they introduce their Deep Neuroevolution technique.\nDespite all this exciting progress, and all these tools and services, it still helps to have\nan idea of what values are reasonable for each hyperparameter, so you can build a\nquick prototype, and restrict the search space. Here are a few guidelines for choosing\nthe number of hidden layers and neurons in an MLP, and selecting good values for\nsome of the main hyperparameters.\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\nFine-Tuning Neural Network Hyperparameters\n|\n17 By Vincent Vanhoucke in his Deep Learning class on Udacity.com.\nreuse parts of a pretrained state-of-the-art network that performs a similar task.\nTraining will be a lot faster and require much less data (we will discuss this in Chap\u2010\nter 11).\nFine-Tuning Neural Network Hyperparameters\n|\n19 A few extra ANN architectures are presented in ???.\nrepresentation learning, and generative adversarial networks to model and generate\ndata.19",

It has actually been shown that an MLP with just one hidden layer\ncan model even the most complex functions provided it has enough neurons. For a\nlong time, these facts convinced researchers that there was no need to investigate any\ndeeper neural networks. But they overlooked the fact that deep networks have a much\nhigher parameter efficiency than shallow ones: they can model complex functions\nusing exponentially fewer neurons than shallow nets, allowing them to reach much\nbetter performance with the same amount of training data.\nTo understand why, suppose you are asked to draw a forest using some drawing soft\u2010\nware, but you are forbidden to use copy/paste. You would have to draw each tree\nindividually, branch per branch, leaf per leaf. If you could instead draw one leaf,\ncopy/paste it to draw a branch, then copy/paste that branch to create a tree, and\nfinally copy/paste this tree to make a forest, you would be finished in no time. Real-\nworld data is often structured in such a hierarchical way and Deep Neural Networks\nautomatically take advantage of this fact: lower hidden layers model low-level struc\u2010\ntures (e.g., line segments of various shapes and orientations), intermediate hidden\nlayers combine these low-level structures to model intermediate-level structures (e.g.,\nsquares, circles), and the highest hidden layers and the output layer combine these\nintermediate structures to model high-level structures (e.g., faces).\nNot only does this hierarchical architecture help DNNs converge faster to a good sol\u2010\nution, it also improves their ability to generalize to new datasets. For example, if you\nhave already trained a model to recognize faces in pictures, and you now want to\ntrain a new neural network to recognize hairstyles, then you can kickstart training by\nreusing the lower layers of the first network. Instead of randomly initializing the\nweights and biases of the first few layers of the new neural network, you can initialize\nthem to the value of the weights and biases of the lower layers of the first network.\nThis way the network will not have to learn from scratch all the low-level structures\nthat occur in most pictures; it will only have to learn the higher-level structures (e.g.,\nhairstyles). This is called transfer learning.\nIn summary, for many problems you can start with just one or two hidden layers and\nit will work just fine (e.g., you can easily reach above 97% accuracy on the MNIST\ndataset using just one hidden layer with a few hundred neurons, and above 98% accu\u2010\nracy using two hidden layers with the same total amount of neurons, in roughly the\nsame amount of training time). For more complex problems, you can gradually ramp\nup the number of hidden layers, until you start overfitting the training set. Very com\u2010\nplex tasks, such as large image classification or speech recognition, typically require\nnetworks with dozens of layers (or even hundreds, but not fully connected ones, as\nwe will see in Chapter 14), and they need a huge amount of training data. However,\nyou will rarely have to train such networks from scratch: it is much more common to",

For example, the MNIST task requires 28\nx 28 = 784 input neurons and 10 output neurons.\nAs for the hidden layers, it used to be a common practice to size them to form a pyra\u2010\nmid, with fewer and fewer neurons at each layer\u2014the rationale being that many low-\nlevel features can coalesce into far fewer high-level features. For example, a typical\nneural network for MNIST may have three hidden layers, the first with 300 neurons,\nthe second with 200, and the third with 100. However, this practice has been largely\nabandoned now, as it seems that simply using the same number of neurons in all hid\u2010\nden layers performs just as well in most cases, or even better, and there is just one\nhyperparameter to tune instead of one per layer\u2014for example, all hidden layers could\nsimply have 150 neurons. However, depending on the dataset, it can sometimes help\nto make the first hidden layer bigger than the others.\nJust like for the number of layers, you can try increasing the number of neurons grad\u2010\nually until the network starts overfitting. In general you will get more bang for the\nbuck by increasing the number of layers than the number of neurons per layer.\nUnfortunately, as you can see, finding the perfect amount of neurons is still somewhat\nof a dark art.\nA simpler approach is to pick a model with more layers and neurons than you\nactually need, then use early stopping to prevent it from overfitting (and other regu\u2010\nlarization techniques, such as dropout, as we will see in Chapter 11).

Here are some of the most important ones, and some tips on how\nto set them:\n\u2022 The learning rate is arguably the most important hyperparameter. In general, the\noptimal learning rate is about half of the maximum learning rate (i.e., the learn\u2010\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\n18 \u201cPractical recommendations for gradient-based training of deep architectures,\u201d Yoshua Bengio (2012).\ning rate above which the training algorithm diverges, as we saw in Chapter 4). So\na simple approach for tuning the learning rate is to start with a large value that\nmakes the training algorithm diverge, then divide this value by 3 and try again,\nand repeat until the training algorithm stops diverging. At that point, you gener\u2010\nally won\u2019t be too far from the optimal learning rate. That said, it is sometimes\nuseful to reduce the learning rate during training: we will discuss this in Chap\u2010\nter 11.\n\u2022 Choosing a better optimizer than plain old Mini-batch Gradient Descent (and\ntuning its hyperparameters) is also quite important. We will discuss this in Chap\u2010\nter 11.\n\u2022 The batch size can also have a significant impact on your model\u2019s performance\nand the training time. In general the optimal batch size will be lower than 32 (in\nApril 2018, Yann Lecun even tweeted \"Friends don\u2019t let friends use mini-batches\nlarger than 32\u201c). A small batch size ensures that each training iteration is very\nfast, and although a large batch size will give a more precise estimate of the gradi\u2010\nents, in practice this does not matter much since the optimization landscape is\nquite complex and the direction of the true gradients do not point precisely in\nthe direction of the optimum. However, having a batch size greater than 10 helps\ntake advantage of hardware and software optimizations, in particular for matrix\nmultiplications, so it will speed up training. Moreover, if you use Batch Normal\u2010\nization (see Chapter 11), the batch size should not be too small (in general no less\nthan 20).\n\u2022 We discussed the choice of the activation function earlier in this chapter: in gen\u2010\neral, the ReLU activation function will be a good default for all hidden layers. For\nthe output layer, it really depends on your task.\n\u2022 In most cases, the number of training iterations does not actually need to be\ntweaked: just use early stopping instead.\nFor more best practices, make sure to read Yoshua Bengio\u2019s great 2012 paper18, which\npresents many practical recommendations for deep networks.\nThis concludes this introduction to artificial neural networks and their implementa\u2010\ntion with Keras.

Once\nthe algorithm has computed the gradient of the cost function with regards to each\nparameter in the network, it uses these gradients to update each parameter with a\nGradient Descent step.\nUnfortunately, gradients often get smaller and smaller as the algorithm progresses\ndown to the lower layers. As a result, the Gradient Descent update leaves the lower\nlayer connection weights virtually unchanged, and training never converges to a good\nsolution. This is called the vanishing gradients problem. In some cases, the opposite\ncan happen: the gradients can grow bigger and bigger, so many layers get insanely\nlarge weight updates and the algorithm diverges. This is the exploding gradients prob\u2010\nlem, which is mostly encountered in recurrent neural networks (see ???). More gener\u2010\nally, deep neural networks suffer from unstable gradients; different layers may learn at\nwidely different speeds.\nAlthough this unfortunate behavior has been empirically observed for quite a while\n(it was one of the reasons why deep neural networks were mostly abandoned for a\nlong time), it is only around 2010 that significant progress was made in understand\u2010\ning it. A paper titled \u201cUnderstanding the Difficulty of Training Deep Feedforward\nNeural Networks\u201d by Xavier Glorot and Yoshua Bengio1 found a few suspects, includ\u2010\ning the combination of the popular logistic sigmoid activation function and the\nweight initialization technique that was most popular at the time, namely random ini\u2010\ntialization using a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\nIn short, they showed that with this activation function and this initialization scheme,\nthe variance of the outputs of each layer is much greater than the variance of its\ninputs. Going forward in the network, the variance keeps increasing after each layer\nuntil the activation function saturates at the top layers. This is actually made worse by\nthe fact that the logistic function has a mean of 0.5, not 0 (the hyperbolic tangent\nfunction has a mean of 0 and behaves slightly better than the logistic function in deep\nnetworks).\n|\nChapter 11: Training Deep Neural Networks\n2 Here\u2019s an analogy: if you set a microphone amplifier\u2019s knob too close to zero, people won\u2019t hear your voice, but\nif you set it too close to the max, your voice will be saturated and people won\u2019t understand what you are say\u2010\ning. Now imagine a chain of such amplifiers: they all need to be set properly in order for your voice to come\nout loud and clear at the end of the chain. Your voice has to come out of each amplifier at the same amplitude\nas it came in.\nLooking at the logistic activation function (see Figure 11-1), you can see that when\ninputs become large (negative or positive), the function saturates at 0 or 1, with a\nderivative extremely close to 0. Thus when backpropagation kicks in, it has virtually\nno gradient to propagate back through the network, and what little gradient exists\nkeeps getting diluted as backpropagation progresses down through the top layers, so\nthere is really nothing left for the lower layers.\nFigure 11-1.

Using Glorot initialization can speed up train\u2010\ning considerably, and it is one of the tricks that led to the current success of Deep\nLearning.\nSome papers3 have provided similar strategies for different activation functions.\nThese strategies differ only by the scale of the variance and whether they use fanavg or\nfanin, as shown in Table 11-1 (for the uniform distribution, just compute r =\n3\u03c32).\nThe initialization strategy for the ReLU activation function (and its variants, includ\u2010\ning the ELU activation described shortly) is sometimes called He initialization (after\nthe last name of its author).

ELU activation function\nIt looks a lot like the ReLU function, with a few major differences:\n\u2022 First it takes on negative values when z < 0, which allows the unit to have an\naverage output closer to 0. This helps alleviate the vanishing gradients problem,\nas discussed earlier. The hyperparameter \u03b1 defines the value that the ELU func\u2010\ntion approaches when z is a large negative number. It is usually set to 1, but you\ncan tweak it like any other hyperparameter if you want.\n\u2022 Second, it has a nonzero gradient for z < 0, which avoids the dead neurons prob\u2010\nlem.\n\u2022 Third, if \u03b1 is equal to 1 then the function is smooth everywhere, including\naround z = 0, which helps speed up Gradient Descent, since it does not bounce as\nmuch left and right of z = 0.\nThe main drawback of the ELU activation function is that it is slower to compute\nthan the ReLU and its variants (due to the use of the exponential function), but dur\u2010\ning training this is compensated by the faster convergence rate. However, at test time\nan ELU network will be slower than a ReLU network.\nMoreover, in a 2017 paper7 by G\u00fcnter Klambauer et al., called \u201cSelf-Normalizing\nNeural Networks\u201d\n, the authors showed that if you build a neural network composed\nexclusively of a stack of dense layers, and if all hidden layers use the SELU activation\nfunction (which is just a scaled version of the ELU activation function, as its name\nsuggests), then the network will self-normalize: the output of each layer will tend to\npreserve mean 0 and standard deviation 1 during training, which solves the vanish\u2010\ning/exploding gradients problem. As a result, this activation function often outper\u2010\nVanishing/Exploding Gradients Problems\n|\nforms other activation functions very significantly for such neural nets (especially\ndeep ones). However, there are a few conditions for self-normalization to happen:\n\u2022 The input features must be standardized (mean 0 and standard deviation 1).\n\u2022 Every hidden layer\u2019s weights must also be initialized using LeCun normal initiali\u2010\nzation. In Keras, this means setting kernel_initializer=\"lecun_normal\".\n\u2022 The network\u2019s architecture must be sequential. Unfortunately, if you try to use\nSELU in non-sequential architectures, such as recurrent networks (see ???) or\nnetworks with skip connections (i.e., connections that skip layers, such as in wide\n& deep nets), self-normalization will not be guaranteed, so SELU will not neces\u2010\nsarily outperform other activation functions.\n\u2022 The paper only guarantees self-normalization if all layers are dense. However, in\npractice the SELU activation function seems to work great with convolutional\nneural nets as well (see Chapter 14).\nSo which activation function should you use for the hidden layers\nof your deep neural networks? Although your mileage will vary, in\ngeneral SELU > ELU > leaky ReLU (and its variants) > ReLU > tanh\n> logistic. If the network\u2019s architecture prevents it from self-\nnormalizing, then ELU may perform better than SELU (since SELU\nis not smooth at z = 0). If you care a lot about runtime latency, then\nyou may prefer leaky ReLU. If you don\u2019t want to tweak yet another\nhyperparameter, you may just use the default \u03b1 values used by\nKeras (e.g., 0.3 for the leaky ReLU). If you have spare time and\ncomputing power, you can use cross-validation to evaluate other\nactivation functions, in particular RReLU if your network is over\u2010\nfitting, or PReLU if you have a huge training set.\nTo use the leaky ReLU activation function, you must create a LeakyReLU instance like\nthis:\nleaky_relu = keras.layers.LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2)\nlayer = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=leaky_relu,\nkernel_initializer=\"he_normal\")\nFor PReLU, just replace LeakyRelu(alpha=0.2) with PReLU(). There is currently no\nofficial implementation of RReLU in Keras, but you can fairly easily implement your\nown (see the exercises at the end of Chapter 12).\nFor SELU activation, just set\nactivation=\"selu\" and\nkernel_initial\nizer=\"lecun_normal\" when creating a layer:\nlayer = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=\"selu\",\nkernel_initializer=\"lecun_normal\")\n|\nChapter 11: Training Deep Neural Networks\n8 \u201cBatch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift,\u201d S.

Each input is offset by its corresponding shift parameter.\n\u2022 \u03f5 is a tiny number to avoid division by zero (typically 10\u20135). This is called a\nsmoothing term.\n\u2022 z(i) is the output of the BN operation: it is a rescaled and shifted version of the\ninputs.\nSo during training, BN just standardizes its inputs then rescales and offsets them.\nGood! What about at test time? Well it is not that simple. Indeed, we may need to\nmake predictions for individual instances rather than for batches of instances: in this\ncase, we will have no way to compute each input\u2019s mean and standard deviation.\nMoreover, even if we do have a batch of instances, it may be too small, or the instan\u2010\nces may not be independent and identically distributed (IID), so computing statistics\nover the batch instances would be unreliable (during training, the batches should not\nbe too small, if possible more than 30 instances, and all instances should be IID, as we\nsaw in Chapter 4). One solution could be to wait until the end of training, then run\nthe whole training set through the neural network, and compute the mean and stan\u2010\ndard deviation of each input of the BN layer. These \u201cfinal\u201d input means and standard\ndeviations can then be used instead of the batch input means and standard deviations\nwhen making predictions. However, it is often preferred to estimate these final statis\u2010\ntics during training using a moving average of the layer\u2019s input means and standard\ndeviations. To sum up, four parameter vectors are learned in each batch-normalized\nlayer: \u03b3 (the ouput scale vector) and \u03b2 (the output offset vector) are learned through\nregular backpropagation, and \u03bc (the final input mean vector), and \u03c3 (the final input\nstandard deviation vector) are estimated using an exponential moving average. Note\nthat \u03bc and \u03c3 are estimated during training, but they are not used at all during train\u2010\ning, only after training (to replace the batch input means and standard deviations in\nEquation 11-3).\nThe authors demonstrated that this technique considerably improved all the deep\nneural networks they experimented with, leading to a huge improvement in the\nImageNet classification task (ImageNet is a large database of images classified into\nmany classes and commonly used to evaluate computer vision systems). The vanish\u2010\n|\nChapter 11: Training Deep Neural Networks\ning gradients problem was strongly reduced, to the point that they could use saturat\u2010\ning activation functions such as the tanh and even the logistic activation function.\nThe networks were also much less sensitive to the weight initialization. They were\nable to use much larger learning rates, significantly speeding up the learning process.\nSpecifically, they note that \u201cApplied to a state-of-the-art image classification model,\nBatch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps,\nand beats the original model by a significant margin. [\u2026] Using an ensemble of\nbatch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet\nclassification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding\nthe accuracy of human raters.\u201d Finally, like a gift that keeps on giving, Batch Normal\u2010\nization also acts like a regularizer, reducing the need for other regularization techni\u2010\nques (such as dropout, described later in this chapter).\nBatch Normalization does, however, add some complexity to the model (although it\ncan remove the need for normalizing the input data, as we discussed earlier). More\u2010\nover, there is a runtime penalty: the neural network makes slower predictions due to\nthe extra computations required at each layer. So if you need predictions to be\nlightning-fast, you may want to check how well plain ELU + He initialization perform\nbefore playing with Batch Normalization.\nYou may find that training is rather slow, because each epoch takes\nmuch more time when you use batch normalization. However, this\nis usually counterbalanced by the fact that convergence is much\nfaster with BN, so it will take fewer epochs to reach the same per\u2010\nformance. All in all, wall time will usually be smaller (this is the\ntime measured by the clock on your wall).\nImplementing Batch Normalization with Keras\nAs with most things with Keras, implementing Batch Normalization is quite simple.\nJust add a BatchNormalization layer before or after each hidden layer\u2019s activation\nfunction, and optionally add a BN layer as well as the first layer in your model. For\nexample, this model applies BN after every hidden layer and as the first layer in the\nmodel (after flattening the input images):\nmodel = keras.models.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=[28, 28]),\nkeras.layers.BatchNormalization(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(300, activation=\"elu\", kernel_initializer=\"he_normal\"),\nkeras.layers.BatchNormalization(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(100, activation=\"elu\", kernel_initializer=\"he_normal\"),\nkeras.layers.BatchNormalization(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(10, activation=\"softmax\")\n])\nVanishing/Exploding Gradients Problems\n|\n9 However, they are estimated during training, based on the training data, so arguably they are trainable. In\nKeras, \u201cNon-trainable\u201d really means \u201cuntouched by backpropagation\u201d\n.\nThat\u2019s all! In this tiny example with just two hidden layers, it\u2019s unlikely that Batch\nNormalization will have a very positive impact, but for deeper networks it can make a\ntremendous difference.\nLet\u2019s zoom in a bit. If you display the model summary, you can see that each BN layer\nadds 4 parameters per input: \u03b3, \u03b2, \u03bc and \u03c3 (for example, the first BN layer adds 3136\nparameters, which is 4 times 784). The last two parameters, \u03bc and \u03c3, are the moving\naverages, they are not affected by backpropagation, so Keras calls them \u201cNon-\ntrainable\u201d9 (if you count the total number of BN parameters, 3136 + 1200 + 400, and\ndivide by two, you get 2,368, which is the total number of non-trainable params in\nthis model).\n>>> model.summary()\nModel: \"sequential_3\"\n_________________________________________________________________\nLayer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #\n=================================================================\nflatten_3 (Flatten)          (None, 784)               0\n_________________________________________________________________\nbatch_normalization_v2 (Batc (None, 784)               3136\n_________________________________________________________________\ndense_50 (Dense)             (None, 300)               235500\n_________________________________________________________________\nbatch_normalization_v2_1 (Ba (None, 300)               1200\n_________________________________________________________________\ndense_51 (Dense)             (None, 100)               30100\n_________________________________________________________________\nbatch_normalization_v2_2 (Ba (None, 100)               400\n_________________________________________________________________\ndense_52 (Dense)             (None, 10)                1010\n=================================================================\nTotal params: 271,346\nTrainable params: 268,978\nNon-trainable params: 2,368\nLet\u2019s look at the parameters of the first BN layer.

These operations will update the\n|\nChapter 11: Training Deep Neural Networks\nmoving averages. Since we are using the TensorFlow backend, these operations are\nTensorFlow operations (we will discuss TF operations in Chapter 12).\n>>> model.layers[1].updates\n[<tf.Operation 'cond_2/Identity' type=Identity>,\n<tf.Operation 'cond_3/Identity' type=Identity>]\nThe authors of the BN paper argued in favor of adding the BN layers before the acti\u2010\nvation functions, rather than after (as we just did). There is some debate about this, as\nit seems to depend on the task. So that\u2019s one more thing you can experiment with to\nsee which option works best on your dataset. To add the BN layers before the activa\u2010\ntion functions, we must remove the activation function from the hidden layers, and\nadd them as separate layers after the BN layers. Moreover, since a Batch Normaliza\u2010\ntion layer includes one offset parameter per input, you can remove the bias term from\nthe previous layer (just pass use_bias=False when creating it):\nmodel = keras.models.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=[28, 28]),\nkeras.layers.BatchNormalization(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(300, kernel_initializer=\"he_normal\", use_bias=False),\nkeras.layers.BatchNormalization(),\nkeras.layers.Activation(\"elu\"),\nkeras.layers.Dense(100, kernel_initializer=\"he_normal\", use_bias=False),\nkeras.layers.Activation(\"elu\"),\nkeras.layers.BatchNormalization(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(10, activation=\"softmax\")\n])\nThe BatchNormalization class has quite a few hyperparameters you can tweak. The\ndefaults will usually be fine, but you may occasionally need to tweak the momentum.\nThis hyperparameter is used when updating the exponential moving averages: given a\nnew value v (i.e., a new vector of input means or standard deviations computed over\nthe current batch), the running average   is updated using the following equation:\nv\nv \u00d7 momentum + v \u00d7 1 \u2212momentum\nA good momentum value is typically close to 1\u2014for example, 0.9, 0.99, or 0.999 (you\nwant more 9s for larger datasets and smaller mini-batches).\nAnother important hyperparameter is axis: it determines which axis should be nor\u2010\nmalized. It defaults to \u20131, meaning that by default it will normalize the last axis (using\nthe means and standard deviations computed across the other axes). For example,\nwhen the input batch is 2D (i.e., the batch shape is [batch size, features]), this means\nthat each input feature will be normalized based on the mean and standard deviation\ncomputed across all the instances in the batch. For example, the first BN layer in the\nprevious code example will independently normalize (and rescale and shift) each of\nthe 784 input features. However, if we move the first BN layer before the Flatten\nVanishing/Exploding Gradients Problems\n|\n10 \u201cFixup Initialization: Residual Learning Without Normalization,\u201d Hongyi Zhang, Yann N.

(2013).\nlayer, then the input batches will be 3D, with shape [batch size, height, width], there\u2010\nfore the BN layer will compute 28 means and 28 standard deviations (one per column\nof pixels, computed across all instances in the batch, and all rows in the column), and\nit will normalize all pixels in a given column using the same mean and standard devi\u2010\nation. There will also be just 28 scale parameters and 28 shift parameters. If instead\nyou still want to treat each of the 784 pixels independently, then you should set\naxis=[1, 2].\nNotice that the BN layer does not perform the same computation during training and\nafter training: it uses batch statistics during training, and the \u201cfinal\u201d statistics after\ntraining (i.e., the final value of the moving averages). Let\u2019s take a peek at the source\ncode of this class to see how this is handled:\nclass BatchNormalization(Layer):\n[...]\ndef call(self, inputs, training=None):\nif training is None:\ntraining = keras.backend.learning_phase()\n[...]\nThe call() method is the one that actually performs the computations, and as you\ncan see it has an extra training argument: if it is None it falls back to keras.back\nend.learning_phase(), which returns 1 during training (the fit() method ensures\nthat). Otherwise, it returns 0. If you ever need to write a custom layer, and it needs to\nbehave differently during training and testing, simply use the same pattern (we will\ndiscuss custom layers in Chapter 12).\nBatch Normalization has become one of the most used layers in deep neural net\u2010\nworks, to the point that it is often omitted in the diagrams, as it is assumed that BN is\nadded after every layer. However, a very recent paper10 by Hongyi Zhang et al. may\nwell change this: the authors show that by using a novel fixed-update (fixup) weight\ninitialization technique, they manage to train a very deep neural network (10,000 lay\u2010\ners!) without BN, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex image classifi\u2010\ncation tasks.",

Until then most people had assumed that if Mother Nature had chosen to use\nroughly sigmoid activation functions in biological neurons, they must be an excellent\nchoice. But it turns out that other activation functions behave much better in deep\nneural networks, in particular the ReLU activation function, mostly because it does\nnot saturate for positive values (and also because it is quite fast to compute).\nUnfortunately, the ReLU activation function is not perfect. It suffers from a problem\nknown as the dying ReLUs: during training, some neurons effectively die, meaning\nthey stop outputting anything other than 0. In some cases, you may find that half of\nyour network\u2019s neurons are dead, especially if you used a large learning rate. A neu\u2010\nron dies when its weights get tweaked in such a way that the weighted sum of its\ninputs are negative for all instances in the training set. When this happens, it just\nkeeps outputting 0s, and gradient descent does not affect it anymore since the gradi\u2010\nent of the ReLU function is 0 when its input is negative.4\nTo solve this problem, you may want to use a variant of the ReLU function, such as\nthe leaky ReLU. This function is defined as LeakyReLU\u03b1(z) = max(\u03b1z, z) (see\nFigure 11-2). The hyperparameter \u03b1 defines how much the function \u201cleaks\u201d: it is the\nslope of the function for z < 0, and is typically set to 0.01. This small slope ensures\nthat leaky ReLUs never die; they can go into a long coma, but they have a chance to\neventually wake up. A 2015 paper5 compared several variants of the ReLU activation\nfunction and one of its conclusions was that the leaky variants always outperformed\nthe strict ReLU activation function. In fact, setting \u03b1 = 0.2 (huge leak) seemed to\nresult in better performance than \u03b1 = 0.01 (small leak). They also evaluated the\nrandomized leaky ReLU (RReLU), where \u03b1 is picked randomly in a given range during\ntraining, and it is fixed to an average value during testing. It also performed fairly well\nand seemed to act as a regularizer (reducing the risk of overfitting the training set).",

It will\nnot only speed up training considerably, but will also require much less training data.\nFor example, suppose that you have access to a DNN that was trained to classify pic\u2010\ntures into 100 different categories, including animals, plants, vehicles, and everyday\nobjects. You now want to train a DNN to classify specific types of vehicles. These\ntasks are very similar, even partly overlapping, so you should try to reuse parts of the\nfirst network (see Figure 11-4).\nReusing Pretrained Layers\n|\nFigure 11-4. Reusing pretrained layers\nIf the input pictures of your new task don\u2019t have the same size as\nthe ones used in the original task, you will usually have to add a\npreprocessing step to resize them to the size expected by the origi\u2010\nnal model. More generally, transfer learning will work best when\nthe inputs have similar low-level features.\nThe output layer of the original model should usually be replaced since it is most\nlikely not useful at all for the new task, and it may not even have the right number of\noutputs for the new task.\nSimilarly, the upper hidden layers of the original model are less likely to be as useful\nas the lower layers, since the high-level features that are most useful for the new task\nmay differ significantly from the ones that were most useful for the original task. You\nwant to find the right number of layers to reuse.\nThe more similar the tasks are, the more layers you want to reuse\n(starting with the lower layers). For very similar tasks, you can try\nkeeping all the hidden layers and just replace the output layer.\nTry freezing all the reused layers first (i.e., make their weights non-trainable, so gradi\u2010\nent descent won\u2019t modify them), then train your model and see how it performs.\nThen try unfreezing one or two of the top hidden layers to let backpropagation tweak\nthem and see if performance improves. The more training data you have, the more\n|\nChapter 11: Training Deep Neural Networks\nlayers you can unfreeze. It is also useful to reduce the learning rate when you unfreeze\nreused layers: this will avoid wrecking their fine-tuned weights.\nIf you still cannot get good performance, and you have little training data, try drop\u2010\nping the top hidden layer(s) and freeze all remaining hidden layers again. You can\niterate until you find the right number of layers to reuse. If you have plenty of train\u2010\ning data, you may try replacing the top hidden layers instead of dropping them, and\neven add more hidden layers.\nReusing Pretrained Layers\n|\nmodel_B_on_A.compile(loss=\"binary_crossentropy\", optimizer=\"sgd\",\nmetrics=[\"accuracy\"])\nYou must always compile your model after you freeze or unfreeze\nlayers.\nNext, we can train the model for a few epochs, then unfreeze the reused layers (which\nrequires compiling the model again) and continue training to fine-tune the reused\nlayers for task B. After unfreezing the reused layers, it is usually a good idea to reduce\nthe learning rate, once again to avoid damaging the reused weights:\nhistory = model_B_on_A.fit(X_train_B, y_train_B, epochs=4,\nvalidation_data=(X_valid_B, y_valid_B))\nfor layer in model_B_on_A.layers[:-1]:\nlayer.trainable = True\noptimizer = keras.optimizers.SGD(lr=1e-4) # the default lr is 1e-3\nmodel_B_on_A.compile(loss=\"binary_crossentropy\", optimizer=optimizer,\nmetrics=[\"accuracy\"])\nhistory = model_B_on_A.fit(X_train_B, y_train_B, epochs=16,\nvalidation_data=(X_valid_B, y_valid_B))\nSo, what\u2019s the final verdict? Well this model\u2019s test accuracy is 99.25%, which means\nthat transfer learning reduced the error rate from 2.8% down to almost 0.7%! That\u2019s a\nfactor of 4!\n>>> model_B_on_A.evaluate(X_test_B, y_test_B)\n[0.06887910133600235, 0.9925]\nAre you convinced? Well you shouldn\u2019t be: I cheated! :) I tried many configurations\nuntil I found one that demonstrated a strong improvement. If you try to change the\nclasses or the random seed, you will see that the improvement generally drops, or\neven vanishes or reverses. What I did is called \u201ctorturing the data until it confesses\u201d\n.\nWhen a paper just looks too positive, you should be suspicious: perhaps the flashy\nnew technique does not help much (in fact, it may even degrade performance), but\nthe authors tried many variants and reported only the best results (which may be due\nto shear luck), without mentioning how many failures they encountered on the way.\nMost of the time, this is not malicious at all, but it is part of the reason why so many\nresults in Science can never be reproduced.\nSo why did I cheat? Well it turns out that transfer learning does not work very well\nwith small dense networks: it works best with deep convolutional neural networks, so\nwe will revisit transfer learning in Chapter 14, using the same techniques (and this\ntime there will be no cheating, I promise!).\n|\nChapter 11: Training Deep Neural Networks\nReusing Pretrained Layers\n|\nmon to train DNNs purely using supervised learning.

Someone built and trained a\nKeras model on that set and got reasonably good performance (>90% accuracy). Let\u2019s\ncall this model A. You now want to tackle a different task: you have images of sandals\nand shirts, and you want to train a binary classifier (positive=shirts, negative=san\u2010\ndals). However, your dataset is quite small, you only have 200 labeled images. When\nyou train a new model for this task (let\u2019s call it model B), with the same architecture\nas model A, it performs reasonably well (97.2% accuracy), but since it\u2019s a much easier\ntask (there are just 2 classes), you were hoping for more. While drinking your morn\u2010\ning coffee, you realize that your task is quite similar to task A, so perhaps transfer\nlearning can help?

So far we have seen\nfour ways to speed up training (and reach a better solution): applying a good initiali\u2010\nzation strategy for the connection weights, using a good activation function, using\nBatch Normalization, and reusing parts of a pretrained network (possibly built on an\nauxiliary task or using unsupervised learning). Another huge speed boost comes from\nusing a faster optimizer than the regular Gradient Descent optimizer. In this section\n|\nChapter 11: Training Deep Neural Networks\n12 \u201cSome methods of speeding up the convergence of iteration methods,\u201d B. Polyak (1964).\nwe will present the most popular ones: Momentum optimization, Nesterov Acceler\u2010\nated Gradient, AdaGrad, RMSProp, and finally Adam and Nadam optimization.\nFaster Optimizers\n|\n13 \u201cA Method for Unconstrained Convex Minimization Problem with the Rate of Convergence O(1/k2),\u201d Yurii\nNesterov (1983).\nley. In contrast, Momentum optimization will roll down the valley faster and faster\nuntil it reaches the bottom (the optimum). In deep neural networks that don\u2019t use\nBatch Normalization, the upper layers will often end up having inputs with very dif\u2010\nferent scales, so using Momentum optimization helps a lot. It can also help roll past\nlocal optima.\nDue to the momentum, the optimizer may overshoot a bit, then\ncome back, overshoot again, and oscillate like this many times\nbefore stabilizing at the minimum. This is one of the reasons why it\nis good to have a bit of friction in the system: it gets rid of these\noscillations and thus speeds up convergence.\nImplementing Momentum optimization in Keras is a no-brainer: just use the SGD\noptimizer and set its momentum hyperparameter, then lie back and profit!\noptimizer = keras.optimizers.SGD(lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)\nThe one drawback of Momentum optimization is that it adds yet another hyperpara\u2010\nmeter to tune. However, the momentum value of 0.9 usually works well in practice\nand almost always goes faster than regular Gradient Descent.\nFaster Optimizers\n|\nThe first step accumulates the square of the gradients into the vector s (recall that the\n\u2297 symbol represents the element-wise multiplication). This vectorized form is equiv\u2010\nalent to computing si \u2190 si + (\u2202 J(\u03b8) / \u2202 \u03b8i)2 for each element si of the vector s; in other\nwords, each si accumulates the squares of the partial derivative of the cost function\nwith regards to parameter \u03b8i. If the cost function is steep along the ith dimension, then\nsi will get larger and larger at each iteration.\nThe second step is almost identical to Gradient Descent, but with one big difference:\nthe gradient vector is scaled down by a factor of  +   (the \u2298 symbol represents the\nelement-wise division, and \u03f5 is a smoothing term to avoid division by zero, typically\nset\nto\n10\u201310).\nThis\nvectorized\nform\nis\nequivalent\nto\ncomputing\n\u03b8i\n\u03b8i \u2212\u03b7 \u2202J \u03b8 / \u2202\u03b8i/ si +   for all parameters \u03b8i (simultaneously).\nIn short, this algorithm decays the learning rate, but it does so faster for steep dimen\u2010\nsions than for dimensions with gentler slopes. This is called an adaptive learning rate.\nIt helps point the resulting updates more directly toward the global optimum (see\nFigure 11-7). One additional benefit is that it requires much less tuning of the learn\u2010\ning rate hyperparameter \u03b7.\nFigure 11-7. AdaGrad versus Gradient Descent\nAdaGrad often performs well for simple quadratic problems, but unfortunately it\noften stops too early when training neural networks. The learning rate gets scaled\ndown so much that the algorithm ends up stopping entirely before reaching the\nglobal optimum. So even though Keras has an Adagrad optimizer, you should not use\nit to train deep neural networks (it may be efficient for simpler tasks such as Linear\nRegression, though). However, understanding Adagrad is helpful to grasp the other\nadaptive learning rate optimizers.\n|\nChapter 11: Training Deep Neural Networks\n15 This algorithm was created by Geoffrey Hinton and Tijmen Tieleman in 2012, and presented by Geoffrey\nHinton in his Coursera class on neural networks (slides: https://homl.info/57; video: https://homl.info/58).\nAmusingly, since the authors did not write a paper to describe it, researchers often cite \u201cslide 29 in lecture 6\u201d\nin their papers.\n16 \u201cAdam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization,\u201d D. Kingma, J. Ba (2015).\n17 These are estimations of the mean and (uncentered) variance of the gradients. The mean is often called the\nfirst moment, while the variance is often called the second moment, hence the name of the algorithm.\nFaster Optimizers\n|\nEquation 11-8.

The only difference is that step 1 computes\nan exponentially decaying average rather than an exponentially decaying sum, but\nthese are actually equivalent except for a constant factor (the decaying average is just\n1 \u2013 \u03b21 times the decaying sum). Steps 3 and 4 are somewhat of a technical detail: since\nm and s are initialized at 0, they will be biased toward 0 at the beginning of training,\nso these two steps will help boost m and s at the beginning of training.\nThe momentum decay hyperparameter \u03b21 is typically initialized to 0.9, while the scal\u2010\ning decay hyperparameter \u03b22 is often initialized to 0.999. As earlier, the smoothing\nterm \u03f5 is usually initialized to a tiny number such as 10\u20137. These are the default values\nfor the Adam class (to be precise, epsilon defaults to None, which tells Keras to use\nkeras.backend.epsilon(), which defaults to 10\u20137; you can change it using\nkeras.backend.set_epsilon()).\noptimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam(lr=0.001, beta_1=0.9, beta_2=0.999)\nSince Adam is an adaptive learning rate algorithm (like AdaGrad and RMSProp), it\nrequires less tuning of the learning rate hyperparameter \u03b7. You can often use the\ndefault value \u03b7 = 0.001, making Adam even easier to use than Gradient Descent.\nIf you are starting to feel overwhelmed by all these different techni\u2010\nques, and wondering how to choose the right ones for your task,\ndon\u2019t worry: some practical guidelines are provided at the end of\nthis chapter.\nFinally, two variants of Adam are worth mentioning:\n|\nChapter 11: Training Deep Neural Networks\n18 \u201cIncorporating Nesterov Momentum into Adam,\u201d Timothy Dozat (2015).\n19 \u201cThe Marginal Value of Adaptive Gradient Methods in Machine Learning,\u201d A. C. Wilson et al. (2017).\n\u2022 Adamax, introduced in the same paper as Adam: notice that in step 2 of Equation\n11-8, Adam accumulates the squares of the gradients in s (with a greater weight\nfor more recent weights). In step 5, if we ignore \u03f5 and steps 3 and 4 (which are\ntechnical details anyway), Adam just scales down the parameter updates by the\nsquare root of s. In short, Adam scales down the parameter updates by the \u21132\nnorm of the time-decayed gradients (recall that the \u21132 norm is the square root of\nthe sum of squares). Adamax just replaces the \u21132 norm with the \u2113\u221e norm (a fancy\nway of saying the max). Specifically, it replaces step 2 in Equation 11-8 with\nmax \u03b22 , \u2207\u03b8J \u03b8 , it drops step 4, and in step 5 it scales down the gradient\nupdates by a factor of s, which is just the max of the time-decayed gradients. In\npractice, this can make Adamax more stable than Adam, but this really depends\non the dataset, and in general Adam actually performs better. So it\u2019s just one\nmore optimizer you can try if you experience problems with Adam on some task.\n\u2022 Nadam optimization18 is more important: it is simply Adam optimization plus\nthe Nesterov trick, so it will often converge slightly faster than Adam. In his\nreport, Timothy Dozat compares many different optimizers on various tasks, and\nfinds that Nadam generally outperforms Adam, but is sometimes outperformed\nby RMSProp.\nAdaptive optimization methods (including RMSProp, Adam and\nNadam optimization) are often great, converging fast to a good sol\u2010\nution. However, a 2017 paper19 by Ashia C. Wilson et al. showed\nthat they can lead to solutions that generalize poorly on some data\u2010\nsets. So when you are disappointed by your model\u2019s performance,\ntry using plain Nesterov Accelerated Gradient instead: your dataset\nmay just be allergic to adaptive gradients. Also check out the latest\nresearch, it is moving fast (e.g., AdaBound).\nAll the optimization techniques discussed so far only rely on the first-order partial\nderivatives (Jacobians). The optimization literature contains amazing algorithms\nbased on the second-order partial derivatives (the Hessians, which are the partial\nderivatives of the Jacobians). Unfortunately, these algorithms are very hard to apply\nto deep neural networks because there are n2 Hessians per output (where n is the\nnumber of parameters), as opposed to just n Jacobians per output. Since DNNs typi\u2010\ncally have tens of thousands of parameters, the second-order optimization algorithms\nFaster Optimizers\n|\n20 \u201cPrimal-Dual Subgradient Methods for Convex Problems,\u201d Yurii Nesterov (2005).\n21 \u201cAd Click Prediction: a View from the Trenches,\u201d H.

(2013).\noften don\u2019t even fit in memory, and even when they do, computing the Hessians is\njust too slow.\nTraining Sparse Models\nAll the optimization algorithms just presented produce dense models, meaning that\nmost parameters will be nonzero. If you need a blazingly fast model at runtime, or if\nyou need it to take up less memory, you may prefer to end up with a sparse model\ninstead.\nOne trivial way to achieve this is to train the model as usual, then get rid of the tiny\nweights (set them to 0). However, this will typically not lead to a very sparse model,\nand it may degrade the model\u2019s performance.\nA better option is to apply strong \u21131 regularization during training, as it pushes the\noptimizer to zero out as many weights as it can (as discussed in Chapter 4 about Lasso\nRegression).\nHowever, in some cases these techniques may remain insufficient. One last option is\nto apply Dual Averaging, often called Follow The Regularized Leader (FTRL), a techni\u2010\nque proposed by Yurii Nesterov.20 When used with \u21131 regularization, this technique\noften leads to very sparse models. Keras implements a variant of FTRL called FTRL-\nProximal21 in the FTRL optimizer.\nFaster Optimizers\n|\n22 \u201cAn Empirical Study of Learning Rates in Deep Neural Networks for Speech Recognition,\u201d A.

The authors concluded that, in this setting,\nboth performance scheduling and exponential scheduling performed well. They\nfavored exponential scheduling because it was easy to tune and it converged slightly\nfaster to the optimal solution (they also mentioned that it was easier to implement\nthan performance scheduling, but in Keras both options are easy).\nImplementing power scheduling in Keras is the easiest option: just set the decay\nhyperparameter when creating an optimizer. The decay is the inverse of s (the num\u2010\nber of steps it takes to divide the learning rate by one more unit), and Keras assumes\nthat c is equal to 1. For example:\noptimizer = keras.optimizers.SGD(lr=0.01, decay=1e-4)\nExponential scheduling and piecewise scheduling are quite simple too. You first need\nto define a function that takes the current epoch and returns the learning rate. For\nexample, let\u2019s implement exponential scheduling:\ndef exponential_decay_fn(epoch):\nreturn 0.01 * 0.1**(epoch / 20)\nIf you do not want to hard-code \u03b70 and s, you can create a function that returns a\nconfigured function:\ndef exponential_decay(lr0, s):\ndef exponential_decay_fn(epoch):\nreturn lr0 * 0.1**(epoch / s)\nreturn exponential_decay_fn\nexponential_decay_fn = exponential_decay(lr0=0.01, s=20)\nNext, just create a LearningRateScheduler callback, giving it the schedule function,\nand pass this callback to the fit() method:\nlr_scheduler = keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler(exponential_decay_fn)\nhistory = model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, [...], callbacks=[lr_scheduler])\n|\nChapter 11: Training Deep Neural Networks\nThe LearningRateScheduler will update the optimizer\u2019s learning_rate attribute at\nthe beginning of each epoch. Updating the learning rate just once per epoch is usually\nenough, but if you want it to be updated more often, for example at every step, you\nneed to write your own callback (see the notebook for an example). This can make\nsense if there are many steps per epoch.\nThe schedule function can optionally take the current learning rate as a second argu\u2010\nment. For example, the following schedule function just multiplies the previous\nlearning rate by 0.1&1/20, which results in the same exponential decay (except the decay\nnow starts at the beginning of epoch 0 instead of 1). This implementation relies on\nthe optimizer\u2019s initial learning rate (contrary to the previous implementation), so\nmake sure to set it appropriately.\ndef exponential_decay_fn(epoch, lr):\nreturn lr * 0.1**(1 / 20)\nWhen you save a model, the optimizer and its learning rate get saved along with it.\nThis means that with this new schedule function, you could just load a trained model\nand continue training where it left off, no problem. However, things are not so simple\nif your schedule function uses the epoch argument: indeed, the epoch does not get\nsaved, and it gets reset to 0 every time you call the fit() method. This could lead to a\nvery large learning rate when you continue training a model where it left off, which\nwould likely damage your model\u2019s weights. One solution is to manually set the fit()\nmethod\u2019s initial_epoch argument so the epoch starts at the right value.\nFor piecewise constant scheduling, you can use a schedule function like the following\none (as earlier, you can define a more general function if you want, see the notebook\nfor an example), then create a LearningRateScheduler callback with this function\nand pass it to the fit() method, just like we did for exponential scheduling:\ndef piecewise_constant_fn(epoch):\nif epoch < 5:\nreturn 0.01\nelif epoch < 15:\nreturn 0.005\nelse:\nreturn 0.001\nFor performance scheduling, simply use the ReduceLROnPlateau callback. For exam\u2010\nple, if you pass the following callback to the fit() method, it will multiply the learn\u2010\ning rate by 0.5 whenever the best validation loss does not improve for 5 consecutive\nepochs (other options are available, please check the documentation for more\ndetails):\nlr_scheduler = keras.callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau(factor=0.5, patience=5)\nLastly, tf.keras offers an alternative way to implement learning rate scheduling: just\ndefine the learning rate using one of the schedules available in keras.optimiz\nFaster Optimizers\n|\ners.schedules, then pass this learning rate to any optimizer. This approach updates\nthe learning rate at each step rather than at each epoch. For example, here is how to\nimplement the same exponential schedule as earlier:\ns = 20 * len(X_train) // 32 # number of steps in 20 epochs (batch size = 32)\nlearning_rate = keras.optimizers.schedules.ExponentialDecay(0.01, s, 0.1)\noptimizer = keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate)\nThis is nice and simple, plus when you save the model, the learning rate and its\nschedule (including its state) get saved as well. However, this approach is not part of\nthe Keras API, it is specific to tf.keras.\nTo sum up, exponential decay or performance scheduling can considerably speed up\nconvergence, so give them a try!",

This is the very simple idea behind\nMomentum optimization, proposed by Boris Polyak in 1964.12 In contrast, regular\nGradient Descent will simply take small regular steps down the slope, so it will take\nmuch more time to reach the bottom.\nRecall that Gradient Descent simply updates the weights \u03b8 by directly subtracting the\ngradient of the cost function J(\u03b8) with regards to the weights (\u2207\u03b8J(\u03b8)) multiplied by\nthe learning rate \u03b7. The equation is: \u03b8 \u2190 \u03b8 \u2013 \u03b7\u2207\u03b8J(\u03b8). It does not care about what the\nearlier gradients were. If the local gradient is tiny, it goes very slowly.\nMomentum optimization cares a great deal about what previous gradients were: at\neach iteration, it subtracts the local gradient from the momentum vector m (multi\u2010\nplied by the learning rate \u03b7), and it updates the weights by simply adding this\nmomentum vector (see Equation 11-4). In other words, the gradient is used for accel\u2010\neration, not for speed. To simulate some sort of friction mechanism and prevent the\nmomentum from growing too large, the algorithm introduces a new hyperparameter\n\u03b2, simply called the momentum, which must be set between 0 (high friction) and 1\n(no friction). A typical momentum value is 0.9.\nEquation 11-4.

For example, if \u03b2 = 0.9, then the\nterminal velocity is equal to 10 times the gradient times the learning rate, so Momen\u2010\ntum optimization ends up going 10 times faster than Gradient Descent! This allows\nMomentum optimization to escape from plateaus much faster than Gradient Descent.\nIn particular, we saw in Chapter 4 that when the inputs have very different scales the\ncost function will look like an elongated bowl (see Figure 4-7). Gradient Descent goes\ndown the steep slope quite fast, but then it takes a very long time to go down the val\u2010",

As you can see, this schedule first drops quickly, then more and more\nslowly. Of course, this requires tuning \u03b70, s (and possibly c).\nExponential scheduling\nSet the learning rate to: \u03b7(t) = \u03b70 0.1t/s.

To avoid this, you can try refactoring your code\nto use loops. Another option is to use Python\u2019s functools.partial() function: it lets\nyou create a thin wrapper for any callable, with some default argument values. For\nexample:\nfrom functools import partial\nRegularizedDense = partial(keras.layers.Dense,\nactivation=\"elu\",\nkernel_initializer=\"he_normal\",\nkernel_regularizer=keras.regularizers.l2(0.01))\nmodel = keras.models.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=[28, 28]),\nRegularizedDense(300),\nRegularizedDense(100),\nRegularizedDense(10, activation=\"softmax\",\nkernel_initializer=\"glorot_uniform\")\n])\nAvoiding Overfitting Through Regularization\n|\nFigure 11-9. Dropout regularization\nIt is quite surprising at first that this rather brutal technique works at all. Would a\ncompany perform better if its employees were told to toss a coin every morning to\ndecide whether or not to go to work? Well, who knows; perhaps it would! The com\u2010\npany would obviously be forced to adapt its organization; it could not rely on any sin\u2010\ngle person to fill in the coffee machine or perform any other critical tasks, so this\nexpertise would have to be spread across several people. Employees would have to\nlearn to cooperate with many of their coworkers, not just a handful of them. The\ncompany would become much more resilient. If one person quit, it wouldn\u2019t make\nmuch of a difference. It\u2019s unclear whether this idea would actually work for compa\u2010\nnies, but it certainly does for neural networks. Neurons trained with dropout cannot\nco-adapt with their neighboring neurons; they have to be as useful as possible on\ntheir own. They also cannot rely excessively on just a few input neurons; they must\npay attention to each of their input neurons. They end up being less sensitive to slight\nchanges in the inputs. In the end you get a more robust network that generalizes bet\u2010\nter.\nAnother way to understand the power of dropout is to realize that a unique neural\nnetwork is generated at each training step. Since each neuron can be either present or\nabsent, there is a total of 2N possible networks (where N is the total number of drop\u2010\npable neurons). This is such a huge number that it is virtually impossible for the same\nneural network to be sampled twice. Once you have run a 10,000 training steps, you\nhave essentially trained 10,000 different neural networks (each with just one training\ninstance). These neural networks are obviously not independent since they share\nmany of their weights, but they are nevertheless all different. The resulting neural\nnetwork can be seen as an averaging ensemble of all these smaller neural networks.\nThere is one small but important technical detail. Suppose p = 50%, in which case\nduring testing a neuron will be connected to twice as many input neurons as it was\n(on average) during training. To compensate for this fact, we need to multiply each\n|\nChapter 11: Training Deep Neural Networks\n25 This is specific to tf.keras, so you may prefer to use keras.backend.set_learning_phase(1) before calling\nthe fit() method (and set it back to 0 right after).\nneuron\u2019s input connection weights by 0.5 after training. If we don\u2019t, each neuron will\nget a total input signal roughly twice as large as what the network was trained on, and\nit is unlikely to perform well. More generally, we need to multiply each input connec\u2010\ntion weight by the keep probability (1 \u2013 p) after training. Alternatively, we can divide\neach neuron\u2019s output by the keep probability during training (these alternatives are\nnot perfectly equivalent, but they work equally well).\nTo implement dropout using Keras, you can use the keras.layers.Dropout layer.\nDuring training, it randomly drops some inputs (setting them to 0) and divides the\nremaining inputs by the keep probability. After training, it does nothing at all, it just\npasses the inputs to the next layer. For example, the following code applies dropout\nregularization before every Dense layer, using a dropout rate of 0.2:\nmodel = keras.models.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=[28, 28]),\nkeras.layers.Dropout(rate=0.2),\nkeras.layers.Dense(300, activation=\"elu\", kernel_initializer=\"he_normal\"),\nkeras.layers.Dropout(rate=0.2),\nkeras.layers.Dense(100, activation=\"elu\", kernel_initializer=\"he_normal\"),\nkeras.layers.Dropout(rate=0.2),\nkeras.layers.Dense(10, activation=\"softmax\")\n])\nSince dropout is only active during training, the training loss is\npenalized compared to the validation loss, so comparing the two\ncan be misleading. In particular, a model may be overfitting the\ntraining set and yet have similar training and validation losses. So\nmake sure to evaluate the training loss without dropout (e.g., after\ntraining). Alternatively, you can call the fit() method inside a\nwith keras.backend.learning_phase_scope(1) block: this will\nforce dropout to be active during both training and validation.25\nIf you observe that the model is overfitting, you can increase the dropout rate. Con\u2010\nversely, you should try decreasing the dropout rate if the model underfits the training\nset. It can also help to increase the dropout rate for large layers, and reduce it for\nsmall ones. Moreover, many state-of-the-art architectures only use dropout after the\nlast hidden layer, so you may want to try this if full dropout is too strong.\nDropout does tend to significantly slow down convergence, but it usually results in a\nmuch better model when tuned properly. So, it is generally well worth the extra time\nand effort.\nAvoiding Overfitting Through Regularization\n|\n26 \u201cDropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Representing Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning,\u201d Y. Gal and Z.\nGhahramani (2016).\n27 Specifically, they show that training a dropout network is mathematically equivalent to approximate Bayesian\ninference in a specific type of probabilistic model called a deep Gaussian Process.\nIf you want to regularize a self-normalizing network based on the\nSELU activation function (as discussed earlier), you should use\nAlphaDropout: this is a variant of dropout that preserves the mean\nand standard deviation of its inputs (it was introduced in the same\npaper as SELU, as regular dropout would break self-normalization).\nAvoiding Overfitting Through Regularization\n|\nThe number of Monte Carlo samples you use (100 in this example)\nis a hyperparameter you can tweak. The higher it is, the more accu\u2010\nrate the predictions and their uncertainty estimates will be. How\u2010\never, it you double it, inference time will also be doubled.\nMoreover, above a certain number of samples, you will notice little\nimprovement. So your job is to find the right tradeoff between\nlatency and accuracy, depending on your application.\nIf your model contains other layers that behave in a special way during training (such\nas Batch Normalization layers), then you should not force training mode like we just\ndid. Instead, you should replace the Dropout layers with the following MCDropout\nclass:\nclass MCDropout(keras.layers.Dropout):\ndef call(self, inputs):\nreturn super().call(inputs, training=True)\nWe just sublass the Dropout layer and override the call() method to force its train\ning argument to True (see Chapter 12). Similarly, you could define an MCAlphaDrop\nout class by subclassing AlphaDropout instead. If you are creating a model from\nscratch, it\u2019s just a matter of using MCDropout rather than Dropout. But if you have a\nmodel that was already trained using Dropout, you need to create a new model, iden\u2010\ntical to the existing model except replacing the Dropout layers with MCDropout, then\ncopy the existing model\u2019s weights to your new model.\nIn short, MC Dropout is a fantastic technique that boosts dropout models and pro\u2010\nvides better uncertainty estimates. And of course, since it is just regular dropout dur\u2010\ning training, it also acts like a regularizer.",

To go the other way round, you can just use the np.arg\nmax() function with axis=1.\nSecondly, regarding the optimizer, \"sgd\" simply means that we will train the model\nusing simple Stochastic Gradient Descent. In other words, Keras will perform the\nbackpropagation algorithm described earlier (i.e., reverse-mode autodiff + Gradient\nDescent). We will discuss more efficient optimizers in Chapter 11 (they improve the\nGradient Descent part, not the autodiff).\nFinally, since this is a classifier, it\u2019s useful to measure its \"accuracy\" during training\nand evaluation.\nTraining and Evaluating the Model\nNow the model is ready to be trained. For this we simply need to call its fit()\nmethod. We pass it the input features (X_train) and the target classes (y_train), as\nwell as the number of epochs to train (or else it would default to just 1, which would\ndefinitely not be enough to converge to a good solution). We also pass a validation set\n(this is optional): Keras will measure the loss and the extra metrics on this set at the\nend of each epoch, which is very useful to see how well the model really performs: if\nthe performance on the training set is much better than on the validation set, your",

If this all sounds like a \u201cone\nweird trick\u201d advertisement, then take a look at the following code. It is the full\nimplementation of MC Dropout, boosting the dropout model we trained earlier,\nwithout retraining it:\nwith keras.backend.learning_phase_scope(1): # force training mode = dropout on\ny_probas = np.stack([model.predict(X_test_scaled)\nfor sample in range(100)])\ny_proba = y_probas.mean(axis=0)\nWe first force training mode on, using a learning_phase_scope(1) context. This\nturns dropout on within the with block. Then we make 100 predictions over the test\nset, and we stack them. Since dropout is on, all predictions will be different. Recall\nthat predict() returns a matrix with one row per instance, and one column per class.\nSince there are 10,000 instances in the test set, and 10 classes, this is a matrix of shape\n[10000, 10]. We stack 100 such matrices, so y_probas is an array of shape [100, 10000,\n10]. Once we average over the first dimension (axis=0), we get y_proba, an array of\nshape [10000, 10], like we would get with a single prediction. That\u2019s all! Averaging\n|\nChapter 11: Training Deep Neural Networks\nover multiple predictions with dropout on gives us a Monte Carlo estimate that is\ngenerally more reliable than the result of a single prediction with dropout off. For\nexample, let\u2019s look at the model\u2019s prediction for the first instance in the test set, with\ndropout off:\n>>> np.round(model.predict(X_test_scaled[:1]), 2)\narray([[0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.01, 0.  , 0.99]],\ndtype=float32)\nThe model seems almost certain that this image belongs to class 9 (ankle boot).\nShould you trust it? Is there really so little room for doubt? Compare this with the\npredictions made when dropout is activated:\n>>> np.round(y_probas[:, :1], 2)\narray([[[0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.14, 0.  , 0.17, 0.  , 0.68]],\n[[0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.16, 0.  , 0.2 , 0.  , 0.64]],\n[[0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.02, 0.  , 0.01, 0.  , 0.97]],\n[...]\nThis tells a very different story: apparently, when we activate dropout, the model is\nnot sure anymore. It still seems to prefer class 9, but sometimes it hesitates with\nclasses 5 (sandal) and 7 (sneaker), which makes sense given they\u2019re all footwear. Once\nwe average over the first dimension, we get the following MC dropout predictions:\n>>> np.round(y_proba[:1], 2)\narray([[0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.22, 0.  , 0.16, 0.  , 0.62]],\ndtype=float32)\nThe model still thinks this image belongs to class 9, but only with a 62% confidence,\nwhich seems much more reasonable than 99%. Plus it\u2019s useful to know exactly which\nother classes it thinks are likely. And you can also take a look at the standard devia\u2010\ntion of the probability estimates:\n>>> y_std = y_probas.std(axis=0)\n>>> np.round(y_std[:1], 2)\narray([[0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.  , 0.28, 0.  , 0.21, 0.02, 0.32]],\ndtype=float32)\nApparently there\u2019s quite a lot of variance in the probability estimates: if you were\nbuilding a risk-sensitive system (e.g., a medical or financial system), you should prob\u2010\nably treat such an uncertain prediction with extreme caution. You definitely would\nnot treat it like a 99% confident prediction. Moreover, the model\u2019s accuracy got a\nsmall boost from 86.8 to 86.9:\n>>> accuracy = np.sum(y_pred == y_test) / len(y_test)\n>>> accuracy\n0.8694",

Max-\nnorm regularization can also help alleviate the vanishing/exploding gradients prob\u2010\nlems (if you are not using Batch Normalization).\n|\nChapter 11: Training Deep Neural Networks\nTo implement max-norm regularization in Keras, just set every hidden layer\u2019s ker\nnel_constraint argument to a max_norm() constraint, with the appropriate max\nvalue, for example:\nkeras.layers.Dense(100, activation=\"elu\", kernel_initializer=\"he_normal\",\nkernel_constraint=keras.constraints.max_norm(1.))\nAfter each training iteration, the model\u2019s fit() method will call the object returned\nby max_norm(), passing it the layer\u2019s weights and getting clipped weights in return,\nwhich then replace the layer\u2019s weights. As we will see in Chapter 12, you can define\nyour own custom constraint function if you ever need to, and use it as the ker\nnel_constraint. You can also constrain the bias terms by setting the bias_con\nstraint argument.\nThe max_norm() function has an axis argument that defaults to 0. A Dense layer usu\u2010\nally has weights of shape [number of inputs, number of neurons], so using axis=0\nmeans that the max norm constraint will apply independently to each neuron\u2019s weight\nvector.

It was developed by the Google\nBrain team and it powers many of Google\u2019s large-scale services, such as Google Cloud\nSpeech, Google Photos, and Google Search. It was open sourced in November 2015,\nand it is now the most popular deep learning library (in terms of citations in papers,\nadoption in companies, stars on github, etc.): countless projects use TensorFlow for\nall sorts of Machine Learning tasks, such as image classification, natural language\nprocessing (NLP), recommender systems, time series forecasting, and much more.\nSo what does TensorFlow actually offer? Here\u2019s a summary:\n\u2022 Its core is very similar to NumPy, but with GPU support.\n\u2022 It also supports distributed computing (across multiple devices and servers).\n\u2022 It includes a kind of just-in-time (JIT) compiler that allows it to optimize compu\u2010\ntations for speed and memory usage: it works by extracting the computation\ngraph from a Python function, then optimizing it (e.g., by pruning unused nodes)\nand finally running it efficiently (e.g., by automatically running independent\noperations in parallel).\n\u2022 Computation graphs can be exported to a portable format, so you can train a\nTensorFlow model in one environment (e.g., using Python on Linux), and run it\nin another (e.g., using Java on an Android device).\n\u2022 It implements autodiff (see Chapter 10 and ???), and provides some excellent\noptimizers, such as RMSProp, Nadam and FTRL (see Chapter 11), so you can\neasily minimize all sorts of loss functions.\n\u2022 TensorFlow offers many more features, built on top of these core features: the\nmost important is of course tf.keras1, but it also has data loading & preprocessing\nops (tf.data, tf.io, etc.), image processing ops (tf.image), signal processing ops\n(tf.signal), and more (see Figure 12-1 for an overview of TensorFlow\u2019s Python\nAPI).\n|\nChapter 12: Custom Models and Training with TensorFlow\n2 If you ever need to (but you probably won\u2019t), you can write your own operations using the C++ API.\n3 If you are a researcher, you may be eligible to use these TPUs for free, see https://tensorflow.org/tfrc/ for more\ndetails.\nFigure 12-1. TensorFlow\u2019s Python API\nWe will cover many of the packages and functions of the Tensor\u2010\nFlow API, but it\u2019s impossible to cover them all so you should really\ntake some time to browse through the API: you will find that it is\nquite rich and well documented.\nAt the lowest level, each TensorFlow operation is implemented using highly efficient\nC++ code2. Many operations (or ops for short) have multiple implementations, called\nkernels: each kernel is dedicated to a specific device type, such as CPUs, GPUs, or\neven TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). As you may know, GPUs can dramatically speed\nup computations by splitting computations into many smaller chunks and running\nthem in parallel across many GPU threads. TPUs are even faster. You can purchase\nyour own GPU devices (for now, TensorFlow only supports Nvidia cards with CUDA\nCompute Capability 3.5+), but TPUs are only available on Google Cloud Machine\nLearning Engine (see ???).3\nTensorFlow\u2019s architecture is shown in Figure 12-2: most of the time your code will\nuse the high level APIs (especially tf.keras and tf.data), but when you need more flexi\u2010\nbility you will use the lower level Python API, handling tensors directly. Note that\nAPIs for other languages are also available. In any case, TensorFlow\u2019s execution\nA Quick Tour of TensorFlow\n|\nengine will take care of running the operations efficiently, even across multiple devi\u2010\nces and machines if you tell it to.\nFigure 12-2. TensorFlow\u2019s architecture\nTensorFlow runs not only on Windows, Linux, and MacOS, but also on mobile devi\u2010\nces (using TensorFlow Lite), including both iOS and Android (see ???). If you do not\nwant to use the Python API, there are also C++, Java, Go and Swift APIs. There is\neven a Javascript implementation called TensorFlow.js that makes it possible to run\nyour models directly in your browser.\nThere\u2019s more to TensorFlow than just the library. TensorFlow is at the center of an\nextensive ecosystem of libraries. First, there\u2019s TensorBoard for visualization (see\nChapter 10). Next, there\u2019s TensorFlow Extended (TFX), which is a set of libraries built\nby Google to productionize TensorFlow projects: it includes tools for data validation,\npreprocessing, model analysis and serving (with TF Serving, see ???). Google also\nlaunched TensorFlow Hub, a way to easily download and reuse pretrained neural net\u2010\nworks. You can also get many neural network architectures, some of them pretrained,\nin TensorFlow\u2019s model garden. Check out the TensorFlow Resources, or https://\ngithub.com/jtoy/awesome-tensorflow for more TensorFlow-based projects. You will\nfind hundreds of TensorFlow projects on GitHub, so it is often easy to find existing\ncode for whatever you are trying to do.\nMore and more ML papers are released along with their implemen\u2010\ntation, and sometimes even with pretrained models. Check out\nhttps://paperswithcode.com/ to easily find them.\n|\nChapter 12: Custom Models and Training with TensorFlow\nLast but not least, TensorFlow has a dedicated team of passionate and helpful devel\u2010\nopers, and a large community contributing to improving it.

A tensor is\nusually a multidimensional array (exactly like a NumPy ndarray), but it can also hold\na scalar (a simple value, such as 42). These tensors will be important when we create\ncustom cost functions, custom metrics, custom layers and more, so let\u2019s see how to\ncreate and manipulate them.\nUsing TensorFlow like NumPy\n|\narray([[11., 12., 13.],\n[14., 15., 16.]], dtype=float32)>\n>>> tf.square(t)\n<tf.Tensor: id=20, shape=(2, 3), dtype=float32, numpy=\narray([[ 1.,  4.,  9.],\n[16., 25., 36.]], dtype=float32)>\n>>> t @ tf.transpose(t)\n<tf.Tensor: id=24, shape=(2, 2), dtype=float32, numpy=\narray([[14., 32.],\n[32., 77.]], dtype=float32)>\nNote that writing t + 10 is equivalent to calling tf.add(t, 10) (indeed, Python calls\nthe magic method t.__add__(10), which just calls tf.add(t, 10)). Other operators\n(like -, *, etc.) are also supported. The @ operator was added in Python 3.5, for matrix\nmultiplication: it is equivalent to calling the tf.matmul() function.\nYou will find all the basic math operations you need (e.g., tf.add(), tf.multiply(),\ntf.square(), tf.exp(), tf.sqrt()\u2026), and more generally most operations that you\ncan find in NumPy (e.g., tf.reshape(), tf.squeeze(), tf.tile()), but sometimes\nwith a different name (e.g., tf.reduce_mean(), tf.reduce_sum(), tf.reduce_max(),\ntf.math.log() are the equivalent of np.mean(), np.sum(), np.max() and np.log()).\nWhen the name differs, there is often a good reason for it: for example, in Tensor\u2010\nFlow you must write tf.transpose(t), you cannot just write t.T like in NumPy. The\nreason is that it does not do exactly the same thing: in TensorFlow, a new tensor is\ncreated with its own copy of the transposed data, while in NumPy, t.T is just a trans\u2010\nposed view on the same data. Similarly, the tf.reduce_sum() operation is named this\nway because its GPU kernel (i.e., GPU implementation) uses a reduce algorithm that\ndoes not guarantee the order in which the elements are added: because 32-bit floats\nhave limited precision, this means that the result may change ever so slightly every\ntime you call this operation. The same is true of tf.reduce_mean() (but of course\ntf.reduce_max() is deterministic).\n|\nChapter 12: Custom Models and Training with TensorFlow\n4 A notable exception is tf.math.log() which is commonly used but there is no tf.log() alias (as it might be\nconfused with logging).\nMany functions and classes have aliases. For example, tf.add()\nand tf.math.add() are the same function. This allows TensorFlow\nto have concise names for the most common operations4, while\npreserving well organized packages.\nKeras\u2019 Low-Level API\nThe Keras API actually has its own low-level API, located in keras.backend. It\nincludes functions like square(), exp(), sqrt() and so on. In tf.keras, these func\u2010\ntions generally just call the corresponding TensorFlow operations. If you want to\nwrite code that will be portable to other Keras implementations, you should use these\nKeras functions. However, they only cover a subset of all functions available in Ten\u2010\nsorFlow, so in this book we will use the TensorFlow operations directly. Here is as\nsimple example using keras.backend, which is commonly named K for short:\n>>> from tensorflow import keras\n>>> K = keras.backend\n>>> K.square(K.transpose(t)) + 10\n<tf.Tensor: id=39, shape=(3, 2), dtype=float32, numpy=\narray([[11., 26.],\n[14., 35.],\n[19., 46.]], dtype=float32)>\nUsing TensorFlow like NumPy\n|\nNotice that NumPy uses 64-bit precision by default, while Tensor\u2010\nFlow uses 32-bit. This is because 32-bit precision is generally more\nthan enough for neural networks, plus it runs faster and uses less\nRAM. So when you create a tensor from a NumPy array, make sure\nto set dtype=tf.float32.\nUsing TensorFlow like NumPy\n|",

If you build other compo\u2010\nnents (such as losses, metrics, initializers or constraints) using\nsubclassing, they may not be portable to other Keras implementa\u2010\ntions.\nLet\u2019s walk through this code:\n\u2022 The constructor accepts **kwargs and passes them to the parent constructor,\nwhich handles standard hyperparameters: the name of the loss and the reduction\nalgorithm to use to aggregate the individual instance losses. By default, it is\n\"sum_over_batch_size\", which means that the loss will be the sum of the\ninstance losses, possibly weighted by the sample weights, if any, and then divide\nthe result by the batch size (not by the sum of weights, so this is not the weighted\nmean).5. Other possible values are \"sum\" and None.\n\u2022 The call() method takes the labels and predictions, computes all the instance\nlosses, and returns them.\n\u2022 The get_config() method returns a dictionary mapping each hyperparameter\nname to its value. It first calls the parent class\u2019s get_config() method, then adds\nthe new hyperparameters to this dictionary (note that the convenient {**x} syn\u2010\ntax was added in Python 3.5).\nYou can then use any instance of this class when you compile the model:\nmodel.compile(loss=HuberLoss(2.), optimizer=\"nadam\")\nWhen you save the model, the threshold will be saved along with it, and when you\nload the model you just need to map the class name to the class itself:\nmodel = keras.models.load_model(\"my_model_with_a_custom_loss_class.h5\",\ncustom_objects={\"HuberLoss\": HuberLoss})\nWhen you save a model, Keras calls the loss instance\u2019s get_config() method and\nsaves the config as JSON in the HDF5 file. When you load the model, it calls the\nfrom_config() class method on the HuberLoss class: this method is implemented by\nthe base class (Loss) and just creates an instance of the class, passing **config to the\nconstructor.\nThat\u2019s it for losses! It was not too hard, was it? Well it\u2019s just as simple for custom acti\u2010\nvation functions, initializers, regularizers, and constraints. Let\u2019s look at these now.\n|\nChapter 12: Custom Models and Training with TensorFlow\nCustom Activation Functions, Initializers, Regularizers, and\nConstraints\nMost Keras functionalities, such as losses, regularizers, constraints, initializers, met\u2010\nrics, activation functions, layers and even full models can be customized in very much\nthe same way. Most of the time, you will just need to write a simple function, with the\nappropriate inputs and outputs. For example, here are examples of a custom activa\u2010\ntion function (equivalent to keras.activations.softplus or tf.nn.softplus), a\ncustom Glorot initializer (equivalent to keras.initializers.glorot_normal), a cus\u2010\ntom \u21131 regularizer (equivalent to keras.regularizers.l1(0.01)) and a custom con\u2010\nstraint\nthat\nensures\nweights\nare\nall\npositive\n(equivalent\nto\nkeras.constraints.nonneg() or tf.nn.relu):\ndef my_softplus(z): # return value is just tf.nn.softplus(z)\nreturn tf.math.log(tf.exp(z) + 1.0)\ndef my_glorot_initializer(shape, dtype=tf.float32):\nstddev = tf.sqrt(2. / (shape[0] + shape[1]))\nreturn tf.random.normal(shape, stddev=stddev, dtype=dtype)\ndef my_l1_regularizer(weights):\nreturn tf.reduce_sum(tf.abs(0.01 * weights))\ndef my_positive_weights(weights): # return value is just tf.nn.relu(weights)\nreturn tf.where(weights < 0., tf.zeros_like(weights), weights)\nAs you can see, the arguments depend on the type of custom function. These custom\nfunctions can then be used normally, for example:\nlayer = keras.layers.Dense(30, activation=my_softplus,\nkernel_initializer=my_glorot_initializer,\nkernel_regularizer=my_l1_regularizer,\nkernel_constraint=my_positive_weights)\nThe activation function will be applied to the output of this Dense layer, and its result\nwill be passed on to the next layer. The layer\u2019s weights will be initialized using the\nvalue returned by the initializer. At each training step the weights will be passed to the\nregularization function to compute the regularization loss, which will be added to the\nmain loss to get the final loss used for training. Finally, the constraint function will be\ncalled after each training step, and the layer\u2019s weights will be replaced by the con\u2010\nstrained weights.\nIf a function has some hyperparameters that need to be saved along with the model,\nthen you will want to subclass the appropriate class, such as keras.regulariz\ners.Regularizer, keras.constraints.Constraint, keras.initializers.Initial\nizer or keras.layers.Layer (for any layer, including activation functions). For\nexample, much like we did for the custom loss, here is a simple class for \u21131 regulariza\u2010\nCustomizing Models and Training Algorithms\n|\n6 However, the Huber loss is seldom used as a metric (the MAE or MSE are preferred).\ntion, that saves its factor hyperparameter (this time we do not need to call the parent\nconstructor or the get_config() method, as they are not defined by the parent class):\nclass MyL1Regularizer(keras.regularizers.Regularizer):\ndef __init__(self, factor):\nself.factor = factor\ndef __call__(self, weights):\nreturn tf.reduce_sum(tf.abs(self.factor * weights))\ndef get_config(self):\nreturn {\"factor\": self.factor}\nNote that you must implement the call() method for losses, layers (including activa\u2010\ntion functions) and models, or the __call__() method for regularizers, initializers\nand constraints. For metrics, things are a bit different, as we will see now.\nCustomizing Models and Training Algorithms\n|\n7 This class is for illustration purposes only. A simpler and better implementation would just subclass the\nkeras.metrics.Mean class, see the notebook for an example.\nLet\u2019s walk through this code:7:\n\u2022 The constructor uses the add_weight() method to create the variables needed to\nkeep track of the metric\u2019s state over multiple batches, in this case the sum of all\nHuber losses (total) and the number of instances seen so far (count). You could\njust create variables manually if you preferred. Keras tracks any tf.Variable that\nis set as an attribute (and more generally, any \u201ctrackable\u201d object, such as layers or\nmodels).\n\u2022 The update_state() method is called when you use an instance of this class as a\nfunction (as we did with the Precision object). It updates the variables given the\nlabels and predictions for one batch (and sample weights, but in this case we just\nignore them).\n\u2022 The result() method computes and returns the final result, in this case just the\nmean Huber metric over all instances. When you use the metric as a function, the\nupdate_state() method gets called first, then the result() method is called,\nand its output is returned.\n\u2022 We also implement the get_config() method to ensure the threshold gets\nsaved along with the model.\n\u2022 The default implementation of the reset_states() method just resets all vari\u2010\nables to 0.0 (but you can override it if needed).\nKeras will take care of variable persistence seamlessly, no action is\nrequired.\nWhen you define a metric using a simple function, Keras automatically calls it for\neach batch, and it keeps track of the mean during each epoch, just like we did man\u2010\nually. So the only benefit of our HuberMetric class is that the threshold will be saved.\nBut of course, some metrics, like precision, cannot simply be averaged over batches:\nin thoses cases, there\u2019s no other option than to implement a streaming metric.\nNow that we have built a streaming metric, building a custom layer will seem like a\nwalk in the park!\n|\nChapter 12: Custom Models and Training with TensorFlow\nCustomizing Models and Training Algorithms\n|\n8 This function is specific to tf.keras. You could use keras.activations.Activation instead.\n9 The Keras API calls this argument input_shape, but since it also includes the batch dimension, I prefer to call\nit batch_input_shape. Same for compute_output_shape().\ndef get_config(self):\nbase_config = super().get_config()\nreturn {**base_config, \"units\": self.units,\n\"activation\": keras.activations.serialize(self.activation)}\nLet\u2019s walk through this code:\n\u2022 The constructor takes all the hyperparameters as arguments (in this example just\nunits and activation), and importantly it also takes a **kwargs argument. It\ncalls the parent constructor, passing it the kwargs: this takes care of standard\narguments such as input_shape, trainable, name, and so on. Then it saves the\nhyperparameters as attributes, converting the activation argument to the\nappropriate activation function using the keras.activations.get() function (it\naccepts functions, standard strings like \"relu\" or \"selu\", or simply None)8.\n\u2022 The build() method\u2019s role is to create the layer\u2019s variables, by calling the\nadd_weight() method for each weight. The build() method is called the first\ntime the layer is used. At that point, Keras will know the shape of this layer\u2019s\ninputs, and it will pass it to the build() method9, which is often necessary to cre\u2010\nate some of the weights. For example, we need to know the number of neurons in\nthe previous layer in order to create the connection weights matrix (i.e., the \"ker\nnel\"): this corresponds to the size of the last dimension of the inputs. At the end\nof the build() method (and only at the end), you must call the parent\u2019s build()\nmethod: this tells Keras that the layer is built (it just sets self.built = True).\n\u2022 The call() method actually performs the desired operations. In this case, we\ncompute the matrix multiplication of the inputs X and the layer\u2019s kernel, we add\nthe bias vector, we apply the activation function to the result, and this gives us the\noutput of the layer.\n\u2022 The compute_output_shape() method simply returns the shape of this layer\u2019s\noutputs. In this case, it is the same shape as the inputs, except the last dimension\nis replaced with the number of neurons in the layer. Note that in tf.keras, shapes\nare instances of the tf.TensorShape class, which you can convert to Python lists\nusing as_list().\n\u2022 The get_config() method is just like earlier. Note that we save the activation\nfunction\u2019s full configuration by calling keras.activations.serialize().\nYou can now use a MyDense layer just like any other layer!\n|\nChapter 12: Custom Models and Training with TensorFlow\nYou can generally omit the compute_output_shape() method, as\ntf.keras automatically infers the output shape, except when the\nlayer is dynamic (as we will see shortly). In other Keras implemen\u2010\ntations, this method is either required or by default it assumes the\noutput shape is the same as the input shape.\nTo create a layer with multiple inputs (e.g., Concatenate), the argument to the call()\nmethod should be a tuple containing all the inputs, and similarly the argument to the\ncompute_output_shape() method should be a tuple containing each input\u2019s batch\nshape. To create a layer with multiple outputs, the call() method should return the\nlist of outputs, and the compute_output_shape() should return the list of batch out\u2010\nput shapes (one per output). For example, the following toy layer takes two inputs\nand returns three outputs:\nclass MyMultiLayer(keras.layers.Layer):\ndef call(self, X):\nX1, X2 = X\nreturn [X1 + X2, X1 * X2, X1 / X2]\ndef compute_output_shape(self, batch_input_shape):\nb1, b2 = batch_input_shape\nreturn [b1, b1, b1] # should probably handle broadcasting rules\nThis layer may now be used like any other layer, but of course only using the func\u2010\ntional and subclassing APIs, not the sequential API (which only accepts layers with\none input and one output).\nIf your layer needs to have a different behavior during training and during testing\n(e.g., if it uses Dropout or BatchNormalization layers), then you must add a train\ning argument to the call() method and use this argument to decide what to do. For\nexample, let\u2019s create a layer that adds Gaussian noise during training (for regulariza\u2010\ntion), but does nothing during testing (Keras actually has a layer that does the same\nthing: keras.layers.GaussianNoise):\nclass MyGaussianNoise(keras.layers.Layer):\ndef __init__(self, stddev, **kwargs):\nsuper().__init__(**kwargs)\nself.stddev = stddev\ndef call(self, X, training=None):\nif training:\nnoise = tf.random.normal(tf.shape(X), stddev=self.stddev)\nreturn X + noise\nelse:\nreturn X\ndef compute_output_shape(self, batch_input_shape):\nreturn batch_input_shape\nCustomizing Models and Training Algorithms\n|\n10 The name \u201csubclassing API\u201d usually refers only to the creation of custom models by subclassing, although\nmany other things can be created by subclassing, as we saw in this chapter.\nWith that, you can now build any custom layer you need! Now let\u2019s create custom\nmodels.\nCustomizing Models and Training Algorithms\n|\niants, such as train_on_batch() or fit_generator()), plus the get_layers()\nmethod (which can return any of the model\u2019s layers by name or by index), and the\nsave() method (and support for keras.models.load_model() and keras.mod\nels.clone_model()). So if models provide more functionalities than layers, why not\njust define every layer as a model? Well, technically you could, but it is probably\ncleaner to distinguish the internal components of your model (layers or reusable\nblocks of layers) from the model itself. The former should subclass the Layer class,\nwhile the latter should subclass the Model class.\nWith that, you can quite naturally and concisely build almost any model that you find\nin a paper, either using the sequential API, the functional API, the subclassing API, or\neven a mix of these. \u201cAlmost\u201d any model? Yes, there are still a couple things that we\nneed to look at: first, how to define losses or metrics based on model internals, and\nsecond how to build a custom training loop.\nCustomizing Models and Training Algorithms\n|\ntial derivatives are equal to 36 and 10, respectively, so the gradient vector at this point\nis (36, 10). But if this were a neural network, the function would be much more com\u2010\nplex, typically with tens of thousands of parameters, and finding the partial deriva\u2010\ntives analytically by hand would be an almost impossible task. One solution could be\nto compute an approximation of each partial derivative by measuring how much the\nfunction\u2019s output changes when you tweak the corresponding parameter:\n>>> w1, w2 = 5, 3\n>>> eps = 1e-6\n>>> (f(w1 + eps, w2) - f(w1, w2)) / eps\n36.000003007075065\n>>> (f(w1, w2 + eps) - f(w1, w2)) / eps\n10.000000003174137\nLooks about right! This works rather well and it is trivial to implement, but it is just\nan approximation, and importantly you need to call f() at least once per parameter\n(not twice, since we could compute f(w1, w2) just once). This makes this approach\nintractable for large neural networks. So instead we should use autodiff (see Chap\u2010\nter 10 and ???). TensorFlow makes this pretty simple:\nw1, w2 = tf.Variable(5.), tf.Variable(3.)\nwith tf.GradientTape() as tape:\nz = f(w1, w2)\ngradients = tape.gradient(z, [w1, w2])\nWe first define two variables w1 and w2, then we create a tf.GradientTape context\nthat will automatically record every operation that involves a variable, and finally we\nask this tape to compute the gradients of the result z with regards to both variables\n[w1, w2]. Let\u2019s take a look at the gradients that TensorFlow computed:\n>>> gradients\n[<tf.Tensor: id=828234, shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=36.0>,\n<tf.Tensor: id=828229, shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=10.0>]\nPerfect! Not only is the result accurate (the precision is only limited by the floating\npoint errors), but the gradient() method only goes through the recorded computa\u2010\ntions once (in reverse order), no matter how many variables there are, so it is incredi\u2010\nbly efficient. It\u2019s like magic!\nOnly put the strict minimum inside the tf.GradientTape() block,\nto save memory. Alternatively, you can pause recording by creating\na with tape.stop_recording() block inside the tf.Gradient\nTape() block.\nThe tape is automatically erased immediately after you call its gradient() method, so\nyou will get an exception if you try to call gradient() twice:\n|\nChapter 12: Custom Models and Training with TensorFlow\nwith tf.GradientTape() as tape:\nz = f(w1, w2)\ndz_dw1 = tape.gradient(z, w1) # => tensor 36.0\ndz_dw2 = tape.gradient(z, w2) # RuntimeError!\nIf you need to call gradient() more than once, you must make the tape persistent,\nand delete it when you are done with it to free resources:\nwith tf.GradientTape(persistent=True) as tape:\nz = f(w1, w2)\ndz_dw1 = tape.gradient(z, w1) # => tensor 36.0\ndz_dw2 = tape.gradient(z, w2) # => tensor 10.0, works fine now!\ndel tape\nBy default, the tape will only track operations involving variables, so if you try to\ncompute the gradient of z with regards to anything else than a variable, the result will\nbe None:\nc1, c2 = tf.constant(5.), tf.constant(3.)\nwith tf.GradientTape() as tape:\nz = f(c1, c2)\ngradients = tape.gradient(z, [c1, c2]) # returns [None, None]\nHowever, you can force the tape to watch any tensors you like, to record every opera\u2010\ntion that involves them. You can then compute gradients with regards to these ten\u2010\nsors, as if they were variables:\nwith tf.GradientTape() as tape:\ntape.watch(c1)\ntape.watch(c2)\nz = f(c1, c2)\ngradients = tape.gradient(z, [c1, c2]) # returns [tensor 36., tensor 10.]\nThis can be useful in some cases, for example if you want to implement a regulariza\u2010\ntion loss that penalizes activations that vary a lot when the inputs vary little: the loss\nwill be based on the gradient of the activations with regards to the inputs. Since the\ninputs are not variables, you would need to tell the tape to watch them.\nIf you compute the gradient of a list of tensors (e.g., [z1, z2, z3]) with regards to\nsome variables (e.g., [w1, w2]), TensorFlow actually efficiently computes the sum of\nthe gradients of these tensors (i.e., gradient(z1, [w1, w2]), plus gradient(z2,\n[w1, w2]), plus gradient(z3, [w1, w2])). Due to the way reverse-mode autodiff\nworks, it is not possible to compute the individual gradients (z1, z2 and z3) without\nactually calling gradient() multiple times (once for z1, once for z2 and once for z3),\nwhich requires making the tape persistent (and deleting it afterwards).\nCustomizing Models and Training Algorithms\n|\nMoreover, it is actually possible to compute second order partial derivatives (the Hes\u2010\nsians, i.e., the partial derivatives of the partial derivatives)! To do this, we need to\nrecord the operations that are performed when computing the first-order partial\nderivatives (the Jacobians): this requires a second tape. Here is how it works:\nwith tf.GradientTape(persistent=True) as hessian_tape:\nwith tf.GradientTape() as jacobian_tape:\nz = f(w1, w2)\njacobians = jacobian_tape.gradient(z, [w1, w2])\nhessians = [hessian_tape.gradient(jacobian, [w1, w2])\nfor jacobian in jacobians]\ndel hessian_tape\nThe inner tape is used to compute the Jacobians, as we did earlier. The outer tape is\nused to compute the partial derivatives of each Jacobian. Since we need to call gradi\nent() once for each Jacobian (or else we would get the sum of the partial derivatives\nover all the Jabobians, as explained earlier), we need the outer tape to be persistent, so\nwe delete it at the end. The Jacobians are obviously the same as earlier (36 and 5), but\nnow we also have the Hessians:\n>>> hessians # dz_dw1_dw1, dz_dw1_dw2, dz_dw2_dw1, dz_dw2_dw2\n[[<tf.Tensor: id=830578, shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=6.0>,\n<tf.Tensor: id=830595, shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=2.0>],\n[<tf.Tensor: id=830600, shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=2.0>, None]]\nLet\u2019s verify these Hessians. The first two are the partial derivatives of 6 * w1 + 2 * w2\n(which is, as we saw earlier, the partial derivative of f with regards to w1), with\nregards to w1 and w2. The result is correct: 6 for w1 and 2 for w2. The next two are the\npartial derivatives of 2 * w1 (the partial derivative of f with regards to w2), with\nregards to w1 and w2, which are 2 for w1 and 0 for w2. Note that TensorFlow returns\nNone instead of 0 since w2 does not appear at all in 2 * w1. TensorFlow also returns\nNone when you use an operation whose gradients are not defined (e.g., tf.argmax()).\nIn some rare cases you may want to stop gradients from backpropagating through\nsome part of your neural network. To do this, you must use the tf.stop_gradient()\nfunction: it just returns its inputs during the forward pass (like tf.identity()), but\nit does not let gradients through during backpropagation (it acts like a constant). For\nexample:\ndef f(w1, w2):\nreturn 3 * w1 ** 2 + tf.stop_gradient(2 * w1 * w2)\nwith tf.GradientTape() as tape:\nz = f(w1, w2) # same result as without stop_gradient()\ngradients = tape.gradient(z, [w1, w2]) # => returns [tensor 30., None]\n|\nChapter 12: Custom Models and Training with TensorFlow\nFinally, you may occasionally run into some numerical issues when computing gradi\u2010\nents. For example, if you compute the gradients of the my_softplus() function for\nlarge inputs, the result will be NaN:\n>>> x = tf.Variable([100.])\n>>> with tf.GradientTape() as tape:\n...     z = my_softplus(x)\n...\n>>> tape.gradient(z, [x])\n<tf.Tensor: [...] numpy=array([nan], dtype=float32)>\nThis is because computing the gradients of this function using autodiff leads to some\nnumerical difficulties: due to floating point precision errors, autodiff ends up com\u2010\nputing infinity divided by infinity (which returns NaN). Fortunately, we can analyti\u2010\ncally find that the derivative of the softplus function is just 1 / (1 + 1 / exp(x)), which\nis numerically stable. Next, we can tell TensorFlow to use this stable function when\ncomputing the gradients of the my_softplus() function, by decorating it with\n@tf.custom_gradient, and making it return both its normal output and the function\nthat computes the derivatives (note that it will receive as input the gradients that were\nbackpropagated so far, down to the softplus function, and according to the chain rule\nwe should multiply them with this function\u2019s gradients):\n@tf.custom_gradient\ndef my_better_softplus(z):\nexp = tf.exp(z)\ndef my_softplus_gradients(grad):\nreturn grad / (1 + 1 / exp)\nreturn tf.math.log(exp + 1), my_softplus_gradients\nNow when we compute the gradients of the my_better_softplus() function, we get\nthe proper result, even for large input values (however, the main output still explodes\nbecause of the exponential: one workaround is to use tf.where() to just return the\ninputs when they are large).\nCongratulations! You can now compute the gradients of any function (provided it is\ndifferentiable at the point where you compute it), you can even compute Hessians,\nblock backpropagation when needed and even write your own gradient functions!\nThis is probably more flexibility than you will ever need, even if you build your own\ncustom training loops, as we will see now.\nCustomizing Models and Training Algorithms\n|\ncompiling the model), implementing this paper requires writing your own custom\nloop.\nYou may also like to write your own custom training loops simply to feel more confi\u2010\ndent that it does precisely what you intent it to do (perhaps you are unsure about\nsome details of the fit() method). It can sometimes feel safer to make everything\nexplicit. However, remember that writing a custom training loop will make your code\nlonger, more error prone and harder to maintain.\nUnless you really need the extra flexibility, you should prefer using\nthe fit() method rather than implementing your own training\nloop, especially if you work in a team.\nFirst, let\u2019s build a simple model. No need to compile it, since we will handle the train\u2010\ning loop manually:\nl2_reg = keras.regularizers.l2(0.05)\nmodel = keras.models.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Dense(30, activation=\"elu\", kernel_initializer=\"he_normal\",\nkernel_regularizer=l2_reg),\nkeras.layers.Dense(1, kernel_regularizer=l2_reg)\n])\nNext, let\u2019s create a tiny function that will randomly sample a batch of instances from\nthe training set (in Chapter 13 we will discuss the Data API, which offers a much bet\u2010\nter alternative):\ndef random_batch(X, y, batch_size=32):\nidx = np.random.randint(len(X), size=batch_size)\nreturn X[idx], y[idx]\nLet\u2019s also define a function that will display the training status, including the number\nof steps, the total number of steps, the mean loss since the start of the epoch (i.e., we\nwill use the Mean metric to compute it), and other metrics:\ndef print_status_bar(iteration, total, loss, metrics=None):\nmetrics = \" - \".join([\"{}: {:.4f}\".format(m.name, m.result())\nfor m in [loss] + (metrics or [])])\nend = \"\" if iteration < total else \"\\n\"\nprint(\"\\r{}/{} - \".format(iteration, total) + metrics,\nend=end)\nThis code is self-explanatory, unless you are unfamiliar with Python string format\u2010\nting: {:.4f} will format a float with 4 digits after the decimal point. Moreover, using\n\\r (carriage return) along with end=\"\" ensures that the status bar always gets printed\non the same line. In the notebook, the print_status_bar() function also includes a\nprogress bar, but you could use the handy tqdm library instead.\n|\nChapter 12: Custom Models and Training with TensorFlow\nWith that, let\u2019s get down to business! First, we need to define some hyperparameters,\nchoose the optimizer, the loss function and the metrics (just the MAE in this exam\u2010\nple):\nn_epochs = 5\nbatch_size = 32\nn_steps = len(X_train) // batch_size\noptimizer = keras.optimizers.Nadam(lr=0.01)\nloss_fn = keras.losses.mean_squared_error\nmean_loss = keras.metrics.Mean()\nmetrics = [keras.metrics.MeanAbsoluteError()]\nAnd now we are ready to build the custom loop!\nfor epoch in range(1, n_epochs + 1):\nprint(\"Epoch {}/{}\".format(epoch, n_epochs))\nfor step in range(1, n_steps + 1):\nX_batch, y_batch = random_batch(X_train_scaled, y_train)\nwith tf.GradientTape() as tape:\ny_pred = model(X_batch, training=True)\nmain_loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss_fn(y_batch, y_pred))\nloss = tf.add_n([main_loss] + model.losses)\ngradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)\noptimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))\nmean_loss(loss)\nfor metric in metrics:\nmetric(y_batch, y_pred)\nprint_status_bar(step * batch_size, len(y_train), mean_loss, metrics)\nprint_status_bar(len(y_train), len(y_train), mean_loss, metrics)\nfor metric in [mean_loss] + metrics:\nmetric.reset_states()\nThere\u2019s a lot going on in this code, so let\u2019s walk through it:\n\u2022 We create two nested loops: one for the epochs, the other for the batches within\nan epoch.\n\u2022 Then we sample a random batch from the training set.\n\u2022 Inside the tf.GradientTape() block, we make a prediction for one batch (using\nthe model as a function), and we compute the loss: it is equal to the main loss\nplus the other losses (in this model, there is one regularization loss per layer).\nSince the mean_squared_error() function returns one loss per instance, we\ncompute the mean over the batch using tf.reduce_mean() (if you wanted to\napply different weights to each instance, this is where you would do it). The regu\u2010\nlarization losses are already reduced to a single scalar each, so we just need to\nsum them (using tf.add_n(), which sums multiple tensors of the same shape\nand data type).\nCustomizing Models and Training Algorithms\n|\n11 The truth is we did not process every single instance in the training set because we sampled instances ran\u2010\ndomly, so some were processed more than once while others were not processed at all. In practice that\u2019s fine.\nMoreover, if the training set size is not a multiple of the batch size, we will miss a few instances.\n12 Alternatively, check out K.learning_phase(), K.set_learning_phase() and K.learning_phase_scope().\n13 With the exception of optimizers, as very few people ever customize these: see the notebook for an example.\n\u2022 Next, we ask the tape to compute the gradient of the loss with regards to each\ntrainable variable (not all variables!), and we apply them to the optimizer to per\u2010\nform a Gradient Descent step.\n\u2022 Next we update the mean loss and the metrics (over the current epoch), and we\ndisplay the status bar.\n\u2022 At the end of each epoch, we display the status bar again to make it look com\u2010\nplete11 and to print a line feed, and we reset the states of the mean loss and the\nmetrics.\nIf you set the optimizer\u2019s clipnorm or clipvalue hyperparameters, it will take care of\nthis for you. If you want to apply any other transformation to the gradients, simply do\nso before calling the apply_gradients() method.\nIf you add weight constraints to your model (e.g., by setting kernel_constraint or\nbias_constraint when creating a layer), you should update the training loop to\napply these constraints just after apply_gradients():\nfor variable in model.variables:\nif variable.constraint is not None:\nvariable.assign(variable.constraint(variable))\nMost importantly, this training loop does not handle layers that behave differently\nduring training and testing (e.g., BatchNormalization or Dropout). To handle these,\nyou need to call the model with training=True and make sure it propagates this to\nevery layer that needs it.12\nAs you can see, there are quite a lot of things you need to get right, it is easy to make a\nmistake. But on the bright side, you get full control, so it\u2019s your call.\nNow that you know how to customize any part of your models13 and training algo\u2010\nrithms, let\u2019s see how you can use TensorFlow\u2019s automatic graph generation feature: it\ncan speed up your custom code considerably, and it will also make it portable to any\nplatform supported by TensorFlow (see ???).",

However, whenever you load it, you need to provide a\ndictionary that maps the function name to the actual function. More generally, when\nyou load a model containing custom objects, you need to map the names to the\nobjects:\nmodel = keras.models.load_model(\"my_model_with_a_custom_loss.h5\",\ncustom_objects={\"huber_fn\": huber_fn})\nWith the current implementation, any error between -1 and 1 is considered \u201csmall\u201d\n.\nBut what if we want a different threshold? One solution is to create a function that\ncreates a configured loss function:\ndef create_huber(threshold=1.0):\ndef huber_fn(y_true, y_pred):\nerror = y_true - y_pred\nis_small_error = tf.abs(error) < threshold\nsquared_loss = tf.square(error) / 2\nlinear_loss  = threshold * tf.abs(error) - threshold**2 / 2\nreturn tf.where(is_small_error, squared_loss, linear_loss)\nreturn huber_fn\nmodel.compile(loss=create_huber(2.0), optimizer=\"nadam\")\nUnfortunately, when you save the model, the threshold will not be saved.

Plus, it\u2019s okay if they are not\neasily interpretable by humans (e.g. cross-entropy). In contrast, metrics are used to\nevaluate a model, they must be more easily interpretable, and they can be non-\ndifferentiable or have 0 gradients everywhere (e.g., accuracy).\nThat said, in most cases, defining a custom metric function is exactly the same as\ndefining a custom loss function. In fact, we could even use the Huber loss function we\ncreated earlier as a metric6, it would work just fine (and persistence would also work\nthe same way, in this case only saving the name of the function, \"huber_fn\"):\nmodel.compile(loss=\"mse\", optimizer=\"nadam\", metrics=[create_huber(2.0)])\nFor each batch during training, Keras will compute this metric and keep track of its\nmean since the beginning of the epoch. Most of the time, this is exactly what you\nwant. But not always! Consider a binary classifier\u2019s precision, for example. As we saw\nin Chapter 3, precision is the number of true positives divided by the number of posi\u2010\ntive predictions (including both true positives and false positives). Suppose the model\nmade 5 positive predictions in the first batch, 4 of which were correct: that\u2019s 80% pre\u2010\ncision. Then suppose the model made 3 positive predictions in the second batch, but\nthey were all incorrect: that\u2019s 0% precision for the second batch. If you just compute\nthe mean of these two precisions, you get 40%. But wait a second, this is not the mod\u2010\nel\u2019s precision over these two batches! Indeed, there were a total of 4 true positives (4 +\n0) out of 8 positive predictions (5 + 3), so the overall precision is 50%, not 40%. What\nwe need is an object that can keep track of the number of true positives and the num\u2010\n|\nChapter 12: Custom Models and Training with TensorFlow\nber of false positives, and compute their ratio when requested. This is precisely what\nthe keras.metrics.Precision class does:\n>>> precision = keras.metrics.Precision()\n>>> precision([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1])\n<tf.Tensor: id=581729, shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=0.8>\n>>> precision([0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n<tf.Tensor: id=581780, shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=0.5>\nIn this example, we created a Precision object, then we used it like a function, pass\u2010\ning it the labels and predictions for the first batch, then for the second batch (note\nthat we could also have passed sample weights). We used the same number of true\nand false positives as in the example we just discussed. After the first batch, it returns\nthe precision of 80%, then after the second batch it returns 50% (which is the overall\nprecision so far, not the second batch\u2019s precision). This is called a streaming metric (or\nstateful metric), as it is gradually updated, batch after batch.\nAt any point, we can call the result() method to get the current value of the metric.\nWe can also look at its variables (tracking the number of true and false positives)\nusing the variables attribute, and reset these variables using the reset_states()\nmethod:\n>>> p.result()\n<tf.Tensor: id=581794, shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=0.5>\n>>> p.variables\n[<tf.Variable 'true_positives:0' [...] numpy=array([4.], dtype=float32)>,\n<tf.Variable 'false_positives:0' [...] numpy=array([4.], dtype=float32)>]\n>>> p.reset_states() # both variables get reset to 0.0\nIf you need to create such a streaming metric, you can just create a subclass of the\nkeras.metrics.Metric class. Here is a simple example that keeps track of the total\nHuber loss and the number of instances seen so far. When asked for the result, it\nreturns the ratio, which is simply the mean Huber loss:\nclass HuberMetric(keras.metrics.Metric):\ndef __init__(self, threshold=1.0, **kwargs):\nsuper().__init__(**kwargs) # handles base args (e.g., dtype)\nself.threshold = threshold\nself.huber_fn = create_huber(threshold)\nself.total = self.add_weight(\"total\", initializer=\"zeros\")\nself.count = self.add_weight(\"count\", initializer=\"zeros\")\ndef update_state(self, y_true, y_pred, sample_weight=None):\nmetric = self.huber_fn(y_true, y_pred)\nself.total.assign_add(tf.reduce_sum(metric))\nself.count.assign_add(tf.cast(tf.size(y_true), tf.float32))\ndef result(self):\nreturn self.total / self.count\ndef get_config(self):\nbase_config = super().get_config()\nreturn {**base_config, \"threshold\": self.threshold}",

If you want to create a custom layer without any weights, the simplest\noption is to write a function and wrap it in a keras.layers.Lambda layer. For exam\u2010\nple, the following layer will apply the exponential function to its inputs:\nexponential_layer = keras.layers.Lambda(lambda x: tf.exp(x))\nThis custom layer can then be used like any other layer, using the sequential API, the\nfunctional API, or the subclassing API. You can also use it as an activation function\n(or you could just use activation=tf.exp, or activation=keras.activations.expo\nnential, or simply activation=\"exponential\"). The exponential layer is sometimes\nused in the output layer of a regression model when the values to predict have very\ndifferent scales (e.g., 0.001, 10., 1000.).\nAs you probably guessed by now, to build a custom stateful layer (i.e., a layer with\nweights), you need to create a subclass of the keras.layers.Layer class. For exam\u2010\nple, the following class implements a simplified version of the Dense layer:\nclass MyDense(keras.layers.Layer):\ndef __init__(self, units, activation=None, **kwargs):\nsuper().__init__(**kwargs)\nself.units = units\nself.activation = keras.activations.get(activation)\ndef build(self, batch_input_shape):\nself.kernel = self.add_weight(\nname=\"kernel\", shape=[batch_input_shape[-1], self.units],\ninitializer=\"glorot_normal\")\nself.bias = self.add_weight(\nname=\"bias\", shape=[self.units], initializer=\"zeros\")\nsuper().build(batch_input_shape) # must be at the end\ndef call(self, X):\nreturn self.activation(X @ self.kernel + self.bias)\ndef compute_output_shape(self, batch_input_shape):\nreturn tf.TensorShape(batch_input_shape.as_list()[:-1] + [self.units])",

For example, suppose you\nwant to build the model represented in Figure 12-3:\nFigure 12-3. Custom Model Example\nThe inputs go through a first dense layer, then through a residual block composed of\ntwo dense layers and an addition operation (as we will see in Chapter 14, a residual\nblock adds its inputs to its outputs), then through this same residual block 3 more\ntimes, then through a second residual block, and the final result goes through a dense\noutput layer. Note that this model does not make much sense, it\u2019s just an example to\nillustrate the fact that you can easily build any kind of model you want, even contain\u2010\n|\nChapter 12: Custom Models and Training with TensorFlow\ning loops and skip connections. To implement this model, it is best to first create a\nResidualBlock layer, since we are going to create a couple identical blocks (and we\nmight want to reuse it in another model):\nclass ResidualBlock(keras.layers.Layer):\ndef __init__(self, n_layers, n_neurons, **kwargs):\nsuper().__init__(**kwargs)\nself.hidden = [keras.layers.Dense(n_neurons, activation=\"elu\",\nkernel_initializer=\"he_normal\")\nfor _ in range(n_layers)]\ndef call(self, inputs):\nZ = inputs\nfor layer in self.hidden:\nZ = layer(Z)\nreturn inputs + Z\nThis layer is a bit special since it contains other layers. This is handled transparently\nby Keras: it automatically detects that the hidden attribute contains trackable objects\n(layers in this case), so their variables are automatically added to this layer\u2019s list of\nvariables. The rest of this class is self-explanatory. Next, let\u2019s use the subclassing API\nto define the model itself:\nclass ResidualRegressor(keras.models.Model):\ndef __init__(self, output_dim, **kwargs):\nsuper().__init__(**kwargs)\nself.hidden1 = keras.layers.Dense(30, activation=\"elu\",\nkernel_initializer=\"he_normal\")\nself.block1 = ResidualBlock(2, 30)\nself.block2 = ResidualBlock(2, 30)\nself.out = keras.layers.Dense(output_dim)\ndef call(self, inputs):\nZ = self.hidden1(inputs)\nfor _ in range(1 + 3):\nZ = self.block1(Z)\nZ = self.block2(Z)\nreturn self.out(Z)\nWe create the layers in the constructor, and use them in the call() method. This\nmodel can then be used like any other model (compile it, fit it, evaluate it and use it to\nmake predictions). If you also want to be able to save the model using the save()\nmethod, and load it using the keras.models.load_model() function, you must\nimplement the get_config() method (as we did earlier) in both the ResidualBlock\nclass and the ResidualRegressor class. Alternatively, you can just save and load the\nweights using the save_weights() and load_weights() methods.\nThe Model class is actually a subclass of the Layer class, so models can be defined and\nused exactly like layers. But a model also has some extra functionalities, including of\ncourse its compile(), fit(), evaluate() and predict() methods (and a few var\u2010",

However, you will occasionally want to\ndefine losses based on other parts of your model, such as the weights or activations of\nits hidden layers. This may be useful for regularization purposes, or to monitor some\ninternal aspect of your model.\nTo define a custom loss based on model internals, just compute it based on any part\nof the model you want, then pass the result to the add_loss() method. For example,\nthe following custom model represents a standard MLP regressor with 5 hidden lay\u2010\ners, except it also implements a reconstruction loss (see ???): we add an extra Dense\nlayer on top of the last hidden layer, and its role is to try to reconstruct the inputs of\nthe model. Since the reconstruction must have the same shape as the model\u2019s inputs,\nwe need to create this Dense layer in the build() method to have access to the shape\nof the inputs. In the call() method, we compute both the regular output of the MLP,\nplus the output of the reconstruction layer. We then compute the mean squared dif\u2010\nference between the reconstructions and the inputs, and we add this value (times\n0.05) to the model\u2019s list of losses by calling add_loss(). During training, Keras will\nadd this loss to the main loss (which is why we scaled down the reconstruction loss,\nto ensure the main loss dominates). As a result, the model will be forced to preserve\nas much information as possible through the hidden layers, even information that is\nnot directly useful for the regression task itself. In practice, this loss sometimes\nimproves generalization; it is a regularization loss:\nclass ReconstructingRegressor(keras.models.Model):\ndef __init__(self, output_dim, **kwargs):\nsuper().__init__(**kwargs)\nself.hidden = [keras.layers.Dense(30, activation=\"selu\",\nkernel_initializer=\"lecun_normal\")\n|\nChapter 12: Custom Models and Training with TensorFlow\nfor _ in range(5)]\nself.out = keras.layers.Dense(output_dim)\ndef build(self, batch_input_shape):\nn_inputs = batch_input_shape[-1]\nself.reconstruct = keras.layers.Dense(n_inputs)\nsuper().build(batch_input_shape)\ndef call(self, inputs):\nZ = inputs\nfor layer in self.hidden:\nZ = layer(Z)\nreconstruction = self.reconstruct(Z)\nrecon_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(reconstruction - inputs))\nself.add_loss(0.05 * recon_loss)\nreturn self.out(Z)\nSimilarly, you can add a custom metric based on model internals by computing it in\nany way you want, as long at the result is the output of a metric object. For example,\nyou can create a keras.metrics.Mean() object in the constructor, then call it in the\ncall() method, passing it the recon_loss, and finally add it to the model by calling\nthe model\u2019s add_metric() method. This way, when you train the model, Keras will\ndisplay both the mean loss over each epoch (the loss is the sum of the main loss plus\n0.05 times the reconstruction loss) and the mean reconstruction error over each\nepoch. Both will go down during training:\nEpoch 1/5\n11610/11610 [=============] [...] loss: 4.3092 - reconstruction_error: 1.7360\nEpoch 2/5\n11610/11610 [=============] [...] loss: 1.1232 - reconstruction_error: 0.8964\n[...]\nIn over 99% of the cases, everything we have discussed so far will be sufficient to\nimplement whatever model you want to build, even with complex architectures, los\u2010\nses, metrics, and so on. However, in some rare cases you may need to customize the\ntraining loop itself. However, before we get there, we need to look at how to compute\ngradients automatically in TensorFlow.",

In TensorFlow 2, they are still\n|\nChapter 12: Custom Models and Training with TensorFlow\nthere, but not as central, and much (much!) simpler to use. To demonstrate this, let\u2019s\nstart with a trivial function that just computes the cube of its input:\ndef cube(x):\nreturn x ** 3\nWe can obviously call this function with a Python value, such as an int or a float, or\nwe can call it with a tensor:\n>>> cube(2)\n>>> cube(tf.constant(2.0))\n<tf.Tensor: id=18634148, shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=8.0>\nNow, let\u2019s use tf.function() to convert this Python function to a TensorFlow Func\u2010\ntion:\n>>> tf_cube = tf.function(cube)\n>>> tf_cube\n<tensorflow.python.eager.def_function.Function at 0x1546fc080>\nThis TF Function can then be used exactly like the original Python function, and it\nwill return the same result (but as tensors):\n>>> tf_cube(2)\n<tf.Tensor: id=18634201, shape=(), dtype=int32, numpy=8>\n>>> tf_cube(tf.constant(2.0))\n<tf.Tensor: id=18634211, shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=8.0>\nUnder the hood, tf.function() analyzed the computations performed by the cube()\nfunction and generated an equivalent computation graph! As you can see, it was\nrather painless (we will see how this works shortly). Alternatively, we could have used\ntf.function as a decorator; this is actually more common:\n@tf.function\ndef tf_cube(x):\nreturn x ** 3\nThe original Python function is still available via the TF Function\u2019s python_function\nattribute, in case you ever need it:\n>>> tf_cube.python_function(2)\nTensorFlow optimizes the computation graph, pruning unused nodes, simplifying\nexpressions (e.g., 1 + 2 would get replaced with 3), and more. Once the optimized\ngraph is ready, the TF Function efficiently executes the operations in the graph, in the\nappropriate order (and in parallel when it can). As a result, a TF Function will usually\nrun much faster than the original Python function, especially if it performs complex\nTensorFlow Functions and Graphs\n|\n14 However, in this trivial example, the computation graph is so small that there is nothing at all to optimize, so\ntf_cube() actually runs much slower than cube().\ncomputations.14 Most of the time you will not really need to know more than that:\nwhen you want to boost a Python function, just transform it into a TF Function.\nThat\u2019s all!\nMoreover, when you write a custom loss function, a custom metric, a custom layer or\nany other custom function, and you use it in a Keras model (as we did throughout\nthis chapter), Keras automatically converts your function into a TF Function, no need\nto use tf.function(). So most of the time, all this magic is 100% transparent.\nYou can tell Keras not to convert your Python functions to TF\nFunctions by setting dynamic=True when creating a custom layer\nor a custom model. Alternatively, you can set run_eagerly=True\nwhen calling the model\u2019s compile() method.\nTF Function generates a new graph for every unique set of input shapes and data\ntypes, and it caches it for subsequent calls. For example, if you call tf_cube(tf.con\nstant(10)), a graph will be generated for int32 tensors of shape []. Then if you call\ntf_cube(tf.constant(20)), the same graph will be reused. But if you then call\ntf_cube(tf.constant([10, 20])), a new graph will be generated for int32 tensors\nof shape [2]. This is how TF Functions handle polymorphism (i.e., varying argument\ntypes and shapes). However, this is only true for tensor arguments: if you pass numer\u2010\nical Python values to a TF Function, a new graph will be generated for every distinct\nvalue: for example, calling tf_cube(10) and tf_cube(20) will generate two graphs.\nIf you call a TF Function many times with different numerical\nPython values, then many graphs will be generated, slowing down\nyour program and using up a lot of RAM. Python values should be\nreserved for arguments that will have few unique values, such as\nhyperparameters like the number of neurons per layer. This allows\nTensorFlow to better optimize each variant of your model.\nTensorFlow Functions and Graphs\n|\nTo view the generated function\u2019s source code, you can call tf.auto\ngraph.to_code(sum_squares.python_function). The code is not\nmeant to be pretty, but it can sometimes help for debugging.\nTensorFlow Functions and Graphs\n|\nLoading and Preprocessing Data with\nTensorFlow\nWith Early Release ebooks, you get books in their earliest form\u2014\nthe author\u2019s raw and unedited content as he or she writes\u2014so you\ncan take advantage of these technologies long before the official\nrelease of these titles. The following will be Chapter 13 in the final\nrelease of the book.\nSo far we have used only datasets that fit in memory, but Deep Learning systems are\noften trained on very large datasets that will not fit in RAM. Ingesting a large dataset\nand preprocessing it efficiently can be tricky to implement with other Deep Learning\nlibraries, but TensorFlow makes it easy thanks to the Data API: you just create a data\u2010\nset object, tell it where to get the data, then transform it in any way you want, and\nTensorFlow takes care of all the implementation details, such as multithreading,\nqueuing, batching, prefetching, and so on.\nOff the shelf, the Data API can read from text files (such as CSV files), binary files\nwith fixed-size records, and binary files that use TensorFlow\u2019s TFRecord format,\nwhich supports records of varying sizes. TFRecord is a flexible and efficient binary\nformat based on Protocol Buffers (an open source binary format). The Data API also\nhas support for reading from SQL databases. Moreover, many Open Source exten\u2010\nsions are available to read from all sorts of data sources, such as Google\u2019s BigQuery\nservice.\nHowever, reading huge datasets efficiently is not the only difficulty: the data also\nneeds to be preprocessed. Indeed, it is not always composed strictly of convenient\nnumerical fields: sometimes there will be text features, categorical features, and so on.\nTo handle this, TensorFlow provides the Features API: it lets you easily convert these\nfeatures to numerical features that can be consumed by your neural network. For\nexample, categorical features with a large number of categories (such as cities, or\nwords) can be encoded using embeddings (as we will see, an embedding is a trainable\ndense vector that represents a category).\nBoth the Data API and the Features API work seamlessly with\ntf.keras.\nIn this chapter, we will cover the Data API, the TFRecord format and the Features\nAPI in detail. We will also take a quick look at a few related projects from Tensor\u2010\nFlow\u2019s ecosystem:\n\u2022 TF Transform (tf.Transform) makes it possible to write a single preprocessing\nfunction that can be run both in batch mode on your full training set, before\ntraining (to speed it up), and then exported to a TF Function and incorporated\ninto your trained model, so that once it is deployed in production, it can take\ncare of preprocessing new instances on the fly.\n\u2022 TF Datasets (TFDS) provides a convenient function to download many common\ndatasets of all kinds, including large ones like ImageNet, and it provides conve\u2010\nnient dataset objects to manipulate them using the Data API.\nSo let\u2019s get started!",

Well, first it starts by analyzing the Python\nfunction\u2019s source code to capture all the control flow statements, such as for loops\nand while loops, if statements, as well as break, continue and return statements.\nThis first step is called autograph. The reason TensorFlow has to analyze the source\ncode is that Python does not provide any other way to capture control flow state\u2010\nments: it offers magic methods like __add__() or __mul__() to capture operators like\n|\nChapter 12: Custom Models and Training with TensorFlow\n+ and *, but there are no __while__() or __if__() magic methods. After analyzing\nthe function\u2019s code, autograph outputs an upgraded version of that function in which\nall the control flow statements are replaced by the appropriate TensorFlow opera\u2010\ntions, such as tf.while_loop() for loops and tf.cond() for if statements. For\nexample, in Figure 12-4, autograph analyzes the source code of the sum_squares()\nPython function, and it generates the tf__sum_squares() function. In this function,\nthe for loop is replaced by the definition of the loop_body() function (containing\nthe body of the original for loop), followed by a call to the for_stmt() function. This\ncall will build the appropriate tf.while_loop() operation in the computation graph.\nFigure 12-4. How TensorFlow generates graphs using autograph and tracing\nNext, TensorFlow calls this \u201cupgraded\u201d function, but instead of passing the actual\nargument, it passes a symbolic tensor, meaning a tensor without any actual value, only\na name, a data type, and a shape. For example, if you call sum_squares(tf.con\nstant(10)), then the tf__sum_squares() function will actually be called with a sym\u2010\nbolic tensor of type int32 and shape []. The function will run in graph mode, meaning\nthat each TensorFlow operation will just add a node in the graph to represent itself\nand its output tensor(s) (as opposed to the regular mode, called eager execution, or\neager mode). In graph mode, TF operations do not perform any actual computations.\nThis should feel familiar if you know TensorFlow 1, as graph mode was the default\nmode. In Figure 12-4, you can see the tf__sum_squares() function being called with\na symbolic tensor as argument (in this case, an int32 tensor of shape []), and the final\ngraph generated during tracing. The ellipses represent operations, and the arrows\nrepresent tensors (both the generated function and the graph are simplified).",

However, there are a few rules to respect:\n\u2022 If you call any external library, including NumPy or even the standard library,\nthis call will run only during tracing, it will not be part of the graph. Indeed, a\nTensorFlow graph can only include TensorFlow constructs (tensors, operations,\nvariables, datasets, and so on). So make sure you use tf.reduce_sum() instead of\nnp.sum(), and tf.sort() instead of the built-in sorted() function, and so on\n(unless you really want the code to run only during tracing).\n\u2014 For example, if you define a TF function f(x) that just returns np.ran\ndom.rand(), a random number will only be generated when the function is\ntraced, so f(tf.constant(2.)) and f(tf.constant(3.)) will return the\nsame random number, but f(tf.constant([2., 3.])) will return a different\none. If you replace np.random.rand() with tf.random.uniform([]), then a\nnew random number will be generated upon every call, since the operation\nwill be part of the graph.\n\u2014 If your non-TensorFlow code has side-effects (such as logging something or\nupdating a Python counter), then you should not expect that side-effect to\noccur every time you call the TF Function, as it will only occur when the func\u2010\ntion is traced.\n\u2014 You can wrap arbitrary Python code in a tf.py_function() operation, but\nthis will hinder performance, as TensorFlow will not be able to do any graph\noptimization on this code, and it will also reduce portability, as the graph will\nonly run on platforms where Python is available (and the right libraries\ninstalled).\n\u2022 You can call other Python functions or TF Functions, but they should follow the\nsame rules, as TensorFlow will also capture their operations in the computation\ngraph. Note that these other functions do not need to be decorated with\n@tf.function.\n\u2022 If the function creates a TensorFlow variable (or any other stateful TensorFlow\nobject, such as a dataset or a queue), it must do so upon the very first call, and\nonly then, or else you will get an exception. It is usually preferable to create vari\u2010\nables outside of the TF Function (e.g., in the build() method of a custom layer).\n|\nChapter 12: Custom Models and Training with TensorFlow\n\u2022 The source code of your Python function should be available to TensorFlow. If\nthe source code is unavailable (for example, if you define your function in the\nPython shell, which does not give access to the source code, or if you deploy only\nthe compiled Python files *.pyc to production), then the graph generation pro\u2010\ncess will fail or have limited functionality.\n\u2022 TensorFlow will only capture for loops that iterate over a tensor or a Dataset. So\nmake sure you use for i in tf.range(10) rather than for i in range(10), or\nelse the loop will not be captured in the graph. Instead, it will run during tracing.\nThis may be what you want, if the for loop is meant to build the graph, for exam\u2010\nple to create each layer in a neural network.\n\u2022 And as always, for performance reasons, you should prefer a vectorized imple\u2010\nmentation whenever you can, rather than using loops.\nIt\u2019s time to sum up! In this chapter we started with a brief overview of TensorFlow,\nthen we looked at TensorFlow\u2019s low-level API, including tensors, operations, variables\nand special data structures. We then used these tools to customize almost every com\u2010\nponent in tf.keras.

Usually you will use datasets that gradually\nread data from disk, but for simplicity let\u2019s just create a dataset entirely in RAM using\ntf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices():\n>>> X = tf.range(10)  # any data tensor\n>>> dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(X)\n>>> dataset\n<TensorSliceDataset shapes: (), types: tf.int32>\nThe from_tensor_slices() function takes a tensor and creates a tf.data.Dataset\nwhose elements are all the slices of X (along the first dimension), so this dataset con\u2010\ntains 10 items: tensors 0, 1, 2, \u2026, 9. In this case we would have obtained the same\ndataset if we had used tf.data.Dataset.range(10).\nYou can simply iterate over a dataset\u2019s items like this:\n>>> for item in dataset:\n...     print(item)\n|\nChapter 13: Loading and Preprocessing Data with TensorFlow\n...\ntf.Tensor(0, shape=(), dtype=int32)\ntf.Tensor(1, shape=(), dtype=int32)\ntf.Tensor(2, shape=(), dtype=int32)\n[...]\ntf.Tensor(9, shape=(), dtype=int32)\nThe Data API\n|\nThe dataset methods do not modify datasets, they create new ones,\nso make sure to keep a reference to these new datasets (e.g., data\nset = ...), or else nothing will happen.\nYou can also apply any transformation you want to the items by calling the map()\nmethod. For example, this creates a new dataset with all items doubled:\n>>> dataset = dataset.map(lambda x: x * 2) # Items: [0,2,4,6,8,10,12]\nThis function is the one you will call to apply any preprocessing you want to your\ndata. Sometimes, this will include computations that can be quite intensive, such as\nreshaping or rotating an image, so you will usually want to spawn multiple threads to\nspeed things up: it\u2019s as simple as setting the num_parallel_calls argument.\nWhile the map() applies a transformation to each item, the apply() method applies a\ntransformation to the dataset as a whole. For example, the following code \u201cunbatches\u201d\nthe dataset, by applying the unbatch() function to the dataset (this function is cur\u2010\nrently experimental, but it will most likely move to the core API in a future release).\nEach item in the new dataset will be a single integer tensor instead of a batch of 7\nintegers:\n>>> dataset = dataset.apply(tf.data.experimental.unbatch()) # Items: 0,2,4,...\nIt is also possible to simply filter the dataset using the filter() method:\n>>> dataset = dataset.filter(lambda x: x < 10) # Items: 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6...\nYou will often want to look at just a few items from a dataset. You can use the take()\nmethod for that:\n>>> for item in dataset.take(3):\n...     print(item)\n...\ntf.Tensor(0, shape=(), dtype=int64)\ntf.Tensor(2, shape=(), dtype=int64)\ntf.Tensor(4, shape=(), dtype=int64)\nThe Data API\n|\nInterleaving Lines From Multiple Files\nFirst, let\u2019s suppose that you loaded the California housing dataset, you shuffled it\n(unless it was already shuffled), you split it into a training set, a validation set and a\ntest set, then you split each set into many CSV files that each look like this (each row\ncontains 8 input features plus the target median house value):\nMedInc,HouseAge,AveRooms,AveBedrms,Popul,AveOccup,Lat,Long,MedianHouseValue\n3.5214,15.0,3.0499,1.1065,1447.0,1.6059,37.63,-122.43,1.442\n5.3275,5.0,6.4900,0.9910,3464.0,3.4433,33.69,-117.39,1.687\n3.1,29.0,7.5423,1.5915,1328.0,2.2508,38.44,-122.98,1.621\n[...]\nLet\u2019s also suppose train_filepaths contains the list of file paths (and you also have\nvalid_filepaths and test_filepaths):\n>>> train_filepaths\n['datasets/housing/my_train_00.csv', 'datasets/housing/my_train_01.csv',...]\nNow let\u2019s create a dataset containing only these file paths:\nfilepath_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.list_files(train_filepaths, seed=42)\nBy default, the list_files() function returns a dataset that shuffles the file paths. In\ngeneral this is a good thing, but you can set shuffle=False if you do not want that,\nfor some reason.\nNext, we can call the interleave() method to read from 5 files at a time and inter\u2010\nleave their lines (skipping the first line of each file, which is the header row, using the\nskip() method):\nn_readers = 5\ndataset = filepath_dataset.interleave(\nlambda filepath: tf.data.TextLineDataset(filepath).skip(1),\ncycle_length=n_readers)\nThe interleave() method will create a dataset that will pull 5 file paths from the\nfilepath_dataset, and for each one it will call the function we gave it (a lambda in\nthis example) to create a new dataset, in this case a TextLineDataset. It will then\ncycle through these 5 datasets, reading one line at a time from each until all datasets\nare out of items. Then it will get the next 5 file paths from the filepath_dataset, and\ninterleave them the same way, and so on until it runs out of file paths.\nFor interleaving to work best, it is preferable to have files of identi\u2010\ncal length, or else the end of the longest files will not be interleaved.\n|\nChapter 13: Loading and Preprocessing Data with TensorFlow\nBy default, interleave() does not use parallelism, it just reads one line at a time\nfrom each file, sequentially. However, if you want it to actually read files in parallel,\nyou can set the num_parallel_calls argument to the number of threads you want.\nYou can even set it to tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE to make TensorFlow choose\nthe right number of threads dynamically based on the available CPU (however, this is\nan experimental feature for now). Let\u2019s look at what the dataset contains now:\n>>> for line in dataset.take(5):\n...     print(line.numpy())\n...\nb'4.2083,44.0,5.3232,0.9171,846.0,2.3370,37.47,-122.2,2.782'\nb'4.1812,52.0,5.7013,0.9965,692.0,2.4027,33.73,-118.31,3.215'\nb'3.6875,44.0,4.5244,0.9930,457.0,3.1958,34.04,-118.15,1.625'\nb'3.3456,37.0,4.5140,0.9084,458.0,3.2253,36.67,-121.7,2.526'\nb'3.5214,15.0,3.0499,1.1065,1447.0,1.6059,37.63,-122.43,1.442'\nThese are the first rows (ignoring the header row) of 5 CSV files, chosen randomly.\nLooks good! But as you can see, these are just byte strings, we need to parse them,\nand also scale the data.\nThe Data API\n|\ntains floats, but that there is no default value, so it will raise an exception if it\nencounters a missing value.\n\u2022 The decode_csv() function returns a list of scalar tensors (one per column) but\nwe need to return 1D tensor arrays. So we call tf.stack() on all tensors except\nfor the last one (the target): this will stack these tensors into a 1D array. We then\ndo the same for the target value (this makes it a 1D tensor array with a single\nvalue, rather than a scalar tensor).\n\u2022 Finally, we scale the input features by subtracting the feature means and then\ndividing by the feature standard deviations, and we return a tuple containing the\nscaled features and the target.\nLet\u2019s test this preprocessing function:\n>>> preprocess(b'4.2083,44.0,5.3232,0.9171,846.0,2.3370,37.47,-122.2,2.782')\n(<tf.Tensor: id=6227, shape=(8,), dtype=float32, numpy=\narray([ 0.16579159,  1.216324  , -0.05204564, -0.39215982, -0.5277444 ,\n-0.2633488 ,  0.8543046 , -1.3072058 ], dtype=float32)>,\n<tf.Tensor: [...], numpy=array([2.782], dtype=float32)>)\nWe can now apply this preprocessing function to the dataset.\nThe Data API\n|\nFigure 13-3. Speedup Training Thanks to Prefetching and Multithreading\nIf you plan to purchase a GPU card, its processing power and its\nmemory size are of course very important (in particular, a large\nRAM is crucial for computer vision), but its memory bandwidth is\njust as important as the processing power to get good performance:\nthis is the number of gigabytes of data it can get in or out of its\nRAM per second.\nWith that, you can now build efficient input pipelines to load and preprocess data\nfrom multiple text files. We have discussed the most common dataset methods, but\nthere are a few more you may want to look at: concatenate(), zip(), window(),\nreduce(), cache(), shard(), flat_map() and padded_batch(). There are also a cou\u2010\nple more class methods: from_generator() and from_tensors(), which create a new\ndataset from a Python generator or a list of tensors respectively. Please check the API\ndocumentation for more details. Also note that there are experimental features avail\u2010\nable in tf.data.experimental, many of which will most likely make it to the core\nAPI in future releases (e.g., check out the CsvDataset class and the SqlDataset\nclasses).\n|\nChapter 13: Loading and Preprocessing Data with TensorFlow\n3 Support for datasets is specific to tf.keras, it will not work on other implementations of the Keras API.\n4 The number of steps per epoch is optional if the dataset just goes through the data once, but if you do not\nspecify it, the progress bar will not be displayed during the first epoch.\n5 Note that for now the dataset must be created within the TF Function. This may be fixed by the time you read\nthese lines (see TensorFlow issue #25414).\nThe Data API\n|\ny_pred = model(X_batch)\nmain_loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss_fn(y_batch, y_pred))\nloss = tf.add_n([main_loss] + model.losses)\ngrads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)\noptimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))\nCongratulations, you now know how to build powerful input pipelines using the Data\nAPI! However, so far we have used CSV files, which are common, simple and conve\u2010\nnient, but they are not really efficient, and they do not support large or complex data\nstructures very well, such as images or audio. So let\u2019s use TFRecords instead.\nIf you are happy with CSV files (or whatever other format you are\nusing), you do not have to use TFRecords. As the saying goes, if it\nain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it! TFRecords are useful when the bottleneck\nduring training is loading and parsing the data.",

It will\ncreate a new dataset that will start by filling up a buffer with the first items of the\nsource dataset, then whenever it is asked for an item, it will pull one out randomly\nfrom the buffer, and replace it with a fresh one from the source dataset, until it has\niterated entirely through the source dataset. At this point it continues to pull out\nitems randomly from the buffer until it is empty. You must specify the buffer size, and\n|\nChapter 13: Loading and Preprocessing Data with TensorFlow\n1 Imagine a sorted deck of cards on your left: suppose you just take the top 3 cards and shuffle them, then pick\none randomly and put it to your right, keeping the other 2 in your hands. Take another card on your left,\nshuffle the 3 cards in your hands and pick one of them randomly, and put it on your right. When you are\ndone going through all the cards like this, you will have a deck of cards on your right: do you think it will be\nperfectly shuffled?\nit is important to make it large enough or else shuffling will not be very efficient.1\nHowever, obviously do not exceed the amount of RAM you have, and even if you\nhave plenty of it, there\u2019s no need to go well beyond the dataset\u2019s size. You can provide\na random seed if you want the same random order every time you run your program.\n>>> dataset = tf.data.Dataset.range(10).repeat(3) # 0 to 9, three times\n>>> dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=5, seed=42).batch(7)\n>>> for item in dataset:\n...     print(item)\n...\ntf.Tensor([0 2 3 6 7 9 4], shape=(7,), dtype=int64)\ntf.Tensor([5 0 1 1 8 6 5], shape=(7,), dtype=int64)\ntf.Tensor([4 8 7 1 2 3 0], shape=(7,), dtype=int64)\ntf.Tensor([5 4 2 7 8 9 9], shape=(7,), dtype=int64)\ntf.Tensor([3 6], shape=(2,), dtype=int64)\nIf you call repeat() on a shuffled dataset, by default it will generate\na new order at every iteration. This is generally a good idea, but if\nyou prefer to reuse the same order at each iteration (e.g., for tests\nor debugging), you can set reshuffle_each_iteration=False.\nFor a large dataset that does not fit in memory, this simple shuffling-buffer approach\nmay not be sufficient, since the buffer will be small compared to the dataset. One sol\u2010\nution is to shuffle the source data itself (for example, on Linux you can shuffle text\nfiles using the shuf command). This will definitely improve shuffling a lot! However,\neven if the source data is shuffled, you will usually want to shuffle it some more, or\nelse the same order will be repeated at each epoch, and the model may end up being\nbiased (e.g., due to some spurious patterns present by chance in the source data\u2019s\norder). To shuffle the instances some more, a common approach is to split the source\ndata into multiple files, then read them in a random order during training. However,\ninstances located in the same file will still end up close to each other. To avoid this\nyou can pick multiple files randomly, and read them simultaneously, interleaving\ntheir lines. Then on top of that you can add a shuffling buffer using the shuffle()\nmethod.

This is a portable, extensi\u2010\nble and efficient binary format developed at Google back in 2001 and Open Sourced\nin 2008, and they are now widely used, in particular in gRPC, Google\u2019s remote proce\u2010\ndure call system. Protocol Buffers are defined using a simple language that looks like\nthis:\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\nmessage Person {\nstring name = 1;\nint32 id = 2;\nrepeated string email = 3;\n}\nThis definition says we are using the protobuf format version 3, and it specifies that\neach Person object6 may (optionally) have a name of type string, an id of type int32,\nand zero or more email fields, each of type string. The numbers 1, 2 and 3 are the\nfield identifiers: they will be used in each record\u2019s binary representation. Once you\nhave a definition in a .proto file, you can compile it. This requires protoc, the proto\u2010\nbuf compiler, to generate access classes in Python (or some other language). Note that\nthe protobuf definitions we will use have already been compiled for you, and their\nPython classes are part of TensorFlow, so you will not need to use protoc. All you\nneed to know is how to use protobuf access classes in Python. To illustrate the basics,\nlet\u2019s look at a simple example that uses the access classes generated for the Person\nprotobuf (the code is explained in the comments):\n>>> from person_pb2 import Person  # import the generated access class\n>>> person = Person(name=\"Al\", id=123, email=[\"a@b.com\"])  # create a Person\n>>> print(person)  # display the Person",

It contains a list of named features, where each\nfeature can either be a list of byte strings, a list of floats or a list of integers. Here is the\nprotobuf definition:\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\nmessage BytesList { repeated bytes value = 1; }\nmessage FloatList { repeated float value = 1 [packed = true]; }\nmessage Int64List { repeated int64 value = 1 [packed = true]; }\n|\nChapter 13: Loading and Preprocessing Data with TensorFlow\n8 Why was Example even defined since it contains no more than a Features object? Well, TensorFlow may one\nday decide to add more fields to it. As long as the new Example definition still contains the features field,\nwith the same id, it will be backward compatible. This extensibility is one of the great features of protobufs.\nmessage Feature {\noneof kind {\nBytesList bytes_list = 1;\nFloatList float_list = 2;\nInt64List int64_list = 3;\n}\n};\nmessage Features { map<string, Feature> feature = 1; };\nmessage Example { Features features = 1; };\nThe definitions of BytesList, FloatList and Int64List are straightforward enough\n([packed = true] is used for repeated numerical fields, for a more efficient encod\u2010\ning). A Feature either contains a BytesList, a FloatList or an Int64List. A Fea\ntures (with an s) contains a dictionary that maps a feature name to the\ncorresponding feature value. And finally, an Example just contains a Features object.8\nHere is how you could create a tf.train.Example representing the same person as\nearlier, and write it to TFRecord file:\nfrom tensorflow.train import BytesList, FloatList, Int64List\nfrom tensorflow.train import Feature, Features, Example\nperson_example = Example(\nfeatures=Features(\nfeature={\n\"name\": Feature(bytes_list=BytesList(value=[b\"Alice\"])),\n\"id\": Feature(int64_list=Int64List(value=[123])),\n\"emails\": Feature(bytes_list=BytesList(value=[b\"a@b.com\",\nb\"c@d.com\"]))\n}))\nThe code is a bit verbose and repetitive, but it\u2019s rather straightforward (and you could\neasily wrap it inside a small helper function). Now that we have an Example protobuf,\nwe can serialize it by calling its SerializeToString() method, then write the result\u2010\ning data to a TFRecord file:\nwith tf.io.TFRecordWriter(\"my_contacts.tfrecord\") as f:\nf.write(person_example.SerializeToString())\nNormally you would write much more than just one example! Typically, you would\ncreate a conversion script that reads from your current format (say, CSV files), creates\nan Example protobuf for each instance, serializes them and saves them to several\nTFRecord files, ideally shuffling them in the process. This requires a bit of work, so\nonce again make sure it is really necessary (perhaps your pipeline works fine with\nCSV files).",

It requires at\nleast two arguments: a string scalar tensor containing the serialized data, and a\ndescription of each feature. The description is a dictionary that maps each feature\nname to either a tf.io.FixedLenFeature descriptor indicating the feature\u2019s shape,\ntype and default value, or a tf.io.VarLenFeature descriptor indicating only the type\n(if the length may vary, such as for the \"emails\" feature). For example:\nfeature_description = {\n\"name\": tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.string, default_value=\"\"),\n\"id\": tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.int64, default_value=0),\n\"emails\": tf.io.VarLenFeature(tf.string),\n}\nfor serialized_example in tf.data.TFRecordDataset([\"my_contacts.tfrecord\"]):\nparsed_example = tf.io.parse_single_example(serialized_example,\nfeature_description)\nThe fixed length features are parsed as regular tensors, but the variable length fea\u2010\ntures are parsed as sparse tensors. You can convert a sparse tensor to a dense tensor\nusing tf.sparse.to_dense(), but in this case it is simpler to just access its values:\n>>> tf.sparse.to_dense(parsed_example[\"emails\"], default_value=b\"\")\n<tf.Tensor: [...] dtype=string, numpy=array([b'a@b.com', b'c@d.com'], [...])>\n>>> parsed_example[\"emails\"].values\n<tf.Tensor: [...] dtype=string, numpy=array([b'a@b.com', b'c@d.com'], [...])>\nA BytesList can contain any binary data you want, including any serialized object.\nFor example, you can use tf.io.encode_jpeg() to encode an image using the JPEG\nformat, and put this binary data in a BytesList. Later, when your code reads the\nTFRecord, it will start by parsing the Example, then you will need to call\ntf.io.decode_jpeg() to parse the data and get the original image (or you can use\ntf.io.decode_image(), which can decode any BMP, GIF, JPEG or PNG image). You\ncan also store any tensor you want in a BytesList by serializing the tensor using\ntf.io.serialize_tensor(), then putting the resulting byte string in a BytesList\nfeature. Later, when you parse the TFRecord, you can parse this data using\ntf.io.parse_tensor().\nInstead of parsing examples one by one using tf.io.parse_single_example(), you\nmay want to parse them batch by batch using tf.io.parse_example():\n|\nChapter 13: Loading and Preprocessing Data with TensorFlow\ndataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset([\"my_contacts.tfrecord\"]).batch(10)\nfor serialized_examples in dataset:\nparsed_examples = tf.io.parse_example(serialized_examples,\nfeature_description)\nAs you can see, the Example proto will probably be sufficient for most use cases.\nHowever, it may be a bit cumbersome to use when you are dealing with lists of lists.\nFor example, suppose you want to classify text documents. Each document may be\nrepresented as a list of sentences, where each sentence is represented as a list of\nwords. And perhaps each document also has a list of comments, where each com\u2010\nment is also represented as a list of words.

Or you can preprocess\nyour data on the fly when loading it with the Data API (e.g., using the dataset\u2019s map()\nmethod, as we saw earlier). Or you can include a preprocessing layer directly in your\nmodel. Whichever solution you prefer, the Features API can help you: it is a set of\nfunctions available in the tf.feature_column package, which let you define how\neach feature (or group of features) in your data should be preprocessed (therefore you\ncan think of this API as the analog of Scikit-Learn\u2019s ColumnTransformer class). We\nwill start by looking at the different types of columns available, and then we will look\nat how to use them.\nLet\u2019s go back to the variant of the California housing dataset that we used in Chap\u2010\nter 2, since it includes a categorical feature and missing data. Here is a simple numeri\u2010\ncal column named \"housing_median_age\":\nhousing_median_age = tf.feature_column.numeric_column(\"housing_median_age\")\nNumeric columns let you specify a normalization function using the normalizer_fn\nargument. For example, let\u2019s tweak the \"housing_median_age\" column to define how\nit should be scaled. Note that this requires computing ahead of time the mean and\nstandard deviation of this feature in the training set:\nage_mean, age_std = X_mean[1], X_std[1]  # The median age is column in 1\nhousing_median_age = tf.feature_column.numeric_column(\n\"housing_median_age\", normalizer_fn=lambda x: (x - age_mean) / age_std)\nIn some cases, it might improve performance to bucketize some numerical features,\neffectively transforming a numerical feature into a categorical feature. For example,\nlet\u2019s create a bucketized column based on the median_income column, with 5 buckets:\nless than 1.5 ($15,000), then 1.5 to 3, 3 to 4.5, 4.5 to 6., and above 6. (notice that when\nyou specify 4 boundaries, there are actually 5 buckets):\nmedian_income = tf.feature_column.numeric_column(\"median_income\")\nbucketized_income = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(\nmedian_income, boundaries=[1.5, 3., 4.5, 6.])\nIf the median_income feature is equal to, say, 3.2, then the bucketized_income feature\nwill automatically be equal to 2 (i.e., the index of the corresponding income bucket).\nChoosing the right boundaries can be somewhat of an art, but one approach is to just\nuse percentiles of the data (e.g., the 10th percentile, the 20th percentile, and so on). If\na feature is multimodal, meaning it has separate peaks in its distribution, you may\n|\nChapter 13: Loading and Preprocessing Data with TensorFlow\nwant to define a bucket for each mode, placing the boundaries in between the peaks.\nWhether you use the percentiles or the modes, you need to analyze the distribution of\nyour data ahead of time, just like we had to measure the mean and standard deviation\nahead of time to normalize the housing_median_age column.\nThe Features API\n|\n9 Since the housing_median_age feature was normalized, the boundaries are for normalized ages.\ncreate a bucketized column for the housing_median_age feature9, and cross it with\nthe ocean_proximity column. The crossed column will compute a hash of every age\n& ocean proximity combination it comes across, modulo the hash_bucket_size, and\nthis will give it the cross category ID. You may then choose to use only this crossed\ncolumn in your model, or also include the individual columns.\nbucketized_age = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(\nhousing_median_age, boundaries=[-1., -0.5, 0., 0.5, 1.]) # age was scaled\nage_and_ocean_proximity = tf.feature_column.crossed_column(\n[bucketized_age, ocean_proximity], hash_bucket_size=100)\nAnother common use case for crossed columns is to cross latitude and longitude into\na single categorical feature: you start by bucketizing the latitude and longitude, for\nexample into 20 buckets each, then you cross these bucketized features into a loca\ntion column. This will create a 20\u00d720 grid over California, and each cell in the grid\nwill correspond to one category:\nlatitude = tf.feature_column.numeric_column(\"latitude\")\nlongitude = tf.feature_column.numeric_column(\"longitude\")\nbucketized_latitude = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(\nlatitude, boundaries=list(np.linspace(32., 42., 20 - 1)))\nbucketized_longitude = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(\nlongitude, boundaries=list(np.linspace(-125., -114., 20 - 1)))\nlocation = tf.feature_column.crossed_column(\n[bucketized_latitude, bucketized_longitude], hash_bucket_size=1000)\nThe Features API\n|\n10 \u201cDistributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality\u201d\n, T. Mikolov et al. (2013).\nFigure 13-4. Embeddings Will Gradually Improve During Training\nWord Embeddings\nNot only will embeddings generally be useful representations for the task at hand, but\nquite often these same embeddings can be reused successfully for other tasks as well.\nThe most common example of this is word embeddings (i.e., embeddings of individual\nwords): when you are working on a natural language processing task, you are often\nbetter off reusing pretrained word embeddings than training your own. The idea of\nusing vectors to represent words dates back to the 1960s, and many sophisticated\ntechniques have been used to generate useful vectors, including using neural net\u2010\nworks, but things really took off in 2013, when Tom\u00e1\u0161 Mikolov and other Google\nresearchers published a paper10 describing how to learn word embeddings using deep\nneural networks, much faster than previous attempts. This allowed them to learn\nembeddings on a very large corpus of text: they trained a deep neural network to pre\u2010\ndict the words near any given word. This allowed them to obtain astounding word\nembeddings. For example, synonyms had very close embeddings, and semantically\nrelated words such as France, Spain, Italy, and so on, ended up clustered together. But\nit\u2019s not just about proximity: word embeddings were also organized along meaningful\naxes in the embedding space. Here is a famous example: if you compute King \u2013 Man\n+ Woman (adding and subtracting the embedding vectors of these words), then the\nresult will be very close to the embedding of the word Queen (see Figure 13-5). In\nother words, the word embeddings encode the concept of gender! Similarly, you can\ncompute Madrid \u2013 Spain + France, and of course the result is close to Paris, which\nseems to show that the notion of capital city was also encoded in the embeddings.\n|\nChapter 13: Loading and Preprocessing Data with TensorFlow\nFigure 13-5. Word Embeddings\nLet\u2019s go back to the Features API. Here is how you could encode the ocean_proxim\nity categories as 2D embeddings:\nocean_proximity_embed = tf.feature_column.embedding_column(ocean_proximity,\ndimension=2)\nEach of the five ocean_proximity categories will now be represented as a 2D vector.\nThese vectors are stored in an embedding matrix with one row per category, and one\ncolumn per embedding dimension, so in this example it is a 5\u00d72 matrix. When an\nembedding column is given a category index as input (say, 3, which corresponds to\nthe category \"NEAR BAY\"), it just performs a lookup in the embedding matrix and\nreturns the corresponding row (say, [0.331, 0.190]). Unfortunately, the embedding\nmatrix can be quite large, especially when you have a large vocabulary: if this is the\ncase, the model can only learn good representations for the categories for which it has\nsufficient training data. To reduce the size of the embedding matrix, you can of\ncourse try lowering the dimension hyperparameter, but if you reduce this parameter\ntoo much, the representations may not be as good. Another option is to reduce the\nvocabulary size (e.g., if you are dealing with text, you can try dropping the rare words\nfrom the vocabulary, and replace them all with a token like \"<unknown>\" or \"<UNK>\").\nIf you are using hash buckets, you can also try reducing the hash_bucket_size (but\nnot too much, or else you will get collisions).\nThe Features API\n|\nIf there are no pretrained embeddings that you can reuse for the\ntask you are trying to tackle, and if you do not have enough train\u2010\ning data to learn them, then you can try to learn them on some\nauxiliary task for which it is easier to obtain plenty of training data.\nAfter that, you can reuse the trained embeddings for your main\ntask.\nThe Features API\n|",

There are two options to encode a categorical feature:\none-hot vectors or embeddings. For the first option, simply use the indicator_col\numn() function:\nocean_proximity_one_hot = tf.feature_column.indicator_column(ocean_proximity)\nA one-hot vector encoding has the size of the vocabulary length, which is fine if there\nare just a few possible categories, but if the vocabulary is large, you will end up with\ntoo many inputs fed to your neural network: it will have too many weights to learn\nand it will probably not perform very well. In particular, this will typically be the case\nwhen you use hash buckets. In this case, you should probably encode them using\nembeddings instead.\n|\nChapter 13: Loading and Preprocessing Data with TensorFlow\nAs a rule of thumb (but your mileage may vary!), if the number of\ncategories is lower than 10, then one-hot encoding is generally the\nway to go. If the number of categories is greater than 50 (which is\noften the case when you use hash buckets), then embeddings are\nusually preferable. In between 10 and 50 categories, you may want\nto experiment with both options and see which one works best for\nyour use case.

For\nthis, all you need to do is add a keras.layers.DenseFeatures layer as the first layer\nin your model, passing it the list of feature columns (excluding the target column):\ncolumns_without_target = columns[:-1]\nmodel = keras.models.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.DenseFeatures(feature_columns=columns_without_target),\n|\nChapter 13: Loading and Preprocessing Data with TensorFlow\nkeras.layers.Dense(1)\n])\nmodel.compile(loss=\"mse\", optimizer=\"sgd\", metrics=[\"accuracy\"])\nsteps_per_epoch = len(X_train) // batch_size\nhistory = model.fit(dataset, steps_per_epoch=steps_per_epoch, epochs=5)\nThe DenseFeatures layer will take care of converting every input feature to a dense\nrepresentation, and it will also apply any extra transformation we specified, such as\nscaling the housing_median_age using the normalizer_fn function we provided. You\ncan take a closer look at what the DenseFeatures layer does by calling it directly:\n>>> some_columns = [ocean_proximity_embed, bucketized_income]\n>>> dense_features = keras.layers.DenseFeatures(some_columns)\n>>> dense_features({\n...     \"ocean_proximity\": [[\"NEAR OCEAN\"], [\"INLAND\"], [\"INLAND\"]],\n...     \"median_income\": [[3.], [7.2], [1.]]\n... })\n...\n<tf.Tensor: id=559790, shape=(3, 7), dtype=float32, numpy=\narray([[ 0. , 0. , 1. , 0. , 0. ,-0.36277947 , 0.30109018],\n[ 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 1. , 0.22548223 , 0.33142096],\n[ 1. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0.22548223 , 0.33142096]], dtype=float32)>\nIn this example, we create a DenseFeatures layer with just two columns, and we call\nit with some data, in the form of a dictionary of features. In this case, since the bucke\ntized_income column relies on the median_income column, the dictionary must\ninclude the \"median_income\" key, and similarly since the ocean_proximity_embed\ncolumn is based on the ocean_proximity column, the dictionary must include the\n\"ocean_proximity\" key. Columns are handled in alphabetical order, so first we look\nat the bucketized income column (its name is the same as the median_income column\nname, plus \"_bucketized\"). The incomes 3, 7.2 and 1 get mapped respectively to cat\u2010\negory 2 (for incomes between 1.5 and 3), category 0 (for incomes below 1.5), and cat\u2010\negory 4 (for incomes greater than 6). Then these category IDs get one-hot encoded:\ncategory 2 gets encoded as [0., 0., 1., 0., 0.] and so on (note that bucketized\ncolumns get one-hot encoded by default, no need to call indicator_column()). Now\non to the ocean_proximity_embed column. The \"NEAR OCEAN\" and \"INLAND\" cate\u2010\ngories just get mapped to their respective embeddings (which were initialized ran\u2010\ndomly).

Tools like Apache Beam let you run efficient data processing pipelines over\nlarge amounts of data, even distributed across multiple servers, so why not use it to\npreprocess all the training data? This works great and indeed can speed up training,\nbut there is one problem: once your model is trained, suppose you want to deploy it\nto a mobile app: you will need to write some code in your app to take care of prepro\u2010\ncessing the data before it is fed to the model. And suppose you also want to deploy\nthe model to TensorFlow.js so it runs in a web browser? Once again, you will need to\nwrite some preprocessing code. This can become a maintenance nightmare: when\u2010\never you want to change the preprocessing logic, you will need to update your Apache\nBeam code, your mobile app code and your Javascript code. It is not only time con\u2010\nsuming, but also error prone: you may end up with subtle differences between the\npreprocessing operations performed before training and the ones performed in your\napp or in the browser. This training/serving skew will lead to bugs or degraded perfor\u2010\nmance.\nOne improvement would be to take the trained model (trained on data that was pre\u2010\nprocessed by your Apache Beam code), and before deploying it to your app or the\nbrowser, add an extra input layer to take care of preprocessing on the fly (either by\nwriting a custom layer or by using a DenseFeatures layer). That\u2019s definitely better,\nsince now you just have two versions of your preprocessing code: the Apache Beam\ncode and the preprocessing layer\u2019s code.\nBut what if you could define your preprocessing operations just once? This is what\nTF Transform was designed for. It is part of TensorFlow Extended (TFX), an end-to-\nend platform for productionizing TensorFlow models. First, to use a TFX component,\nsuch as TF Transform, you must install it, it does not come bundled with TensorFlow.\nYou define your preprocessing function just once (in Python), by using TF Transform\nfunctions for scaling, bucketizing, crossing features, and more. You can also use any\nTensorFlow operation you need. Here is what this preprocessing function might look\nlike if we just had two features:\nimport tensorflow_transform as tft\ndef preprocess(inputs):  # inputs is a batch of input features\nmedian_age = inputs[\"housing_median_age\"]\nocean_proximity = inputs[\"ocean_proximity\"]\nstandardized_age = tft.scale_to_z_score(median_age - tft.mean(median_age))\nocean_proximity_id = tft.compute_and_apply_vocabulary(ocean_proximity)\nreturn {\n\"standardized_median_age\": standardized_age,\n|\nChapter 13: Loading and Preprocessing Data with TensorFlow\n11 At the time of writing, TFDS requires you to download a few files manually for ImageNet (for legal reasons),\nbut this will hopefully get resolved soon.\n\"ocean_proximity_id\": ocean_proximity_id\n}\nNext, TF Transform lets you apply this preprocess() function to the whole training\nset using Apache Beam (it provides an AnalyzeAndTransformDataset class that you\ncan use for this purpose in your Apache Beam pipeline). In the process, it will also\ncompute all the necessary statistics over the whole training set: in this example, the\nmean and standard deviation of the housing_median_age feature, and the vocabulary\nfor the ocean_proximity feature. The components that compute these statistics are\ncalled analyzers.\nImportantly, TF Transform will also generate an equivalent TensorFlow Function that\nyou can plug into the model you deploy. This TF Function contains all the necessary\nstatistics computed by Apache Beam (the mean, standard deviation, and vocabulary),\nsimply included as constants.\nAt the time of this writing, TF Transform only supports Tensor\u2010\nFlow 1. Moreover, Apache Beam only has partial support for\nPython 3. That said, both these limitations will likely be fixed by\nthe time your read this.\nWith the Data API, TFRecords, the Features API and TF Transform, you can build\nhighly scalable input pipelines for training, and also benefit from fast and portable\ndata preprocessing in production.\nBut what if you just wanted to use a standard dataset?

Why are these tasks so effortless to us humans? The answer lies in the\nfact that perception largely takes place outside the realm of our consciousness, within\nspecialized visual, auditory, and other sensory modules in our brains. By the time\nsensory information reaches our consciousness, it is already adorned with high-level\nfeatures; for example, when you look at a picture of a cute puppy, you cannot choose\nnot to see the puppy, or not to notice its cuteness. Nor can you explain how you rec\u2010\nognize a cute puppy; it\u2019s just obvious to you. Thus, we cannot trust our subjective\nexperience: perception is not trivial at all, and to understand it we must look at how\nthe sensory modules work.\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) emerged from the study of the brain\u2019s visual\ncortex, and they have been used in image recognition since the 1980s. In the last few\nyears, thanks to the increase in computational power, the amount of available training\ndata, and the tricks presented in Chapter 11 for training deep nets, CNNs have man\u2010\naged to achieve superhuman performance on some complex visual tasks.

Hubel and Torsten Wiesel performed a series of experiments on cats in\n19581 and 19592 (and a few years later on monkeys3), giving crucial insights on the\nstructure of the visual cortex (the authors received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or\nMedicine in 1981 for their work). In particular, they showed that many neurons in\nthe visual cortex have a small local receptive field, meaning they react only to visual\nstimuli located in a limited region of the visual field (see Figure 14-1, in which the\nlocal receptive fields of five neurons are represented by dashed circles). The receptive\nfields of different neurons may overlap, and together they tile the whole visual field.\nMoreover, the authors showed that some neurons react only to images of horizontal\nlines, while others react only to lines with different orientations (two neurons may\nhave the same receptive field but react to different line orientations). They also\nnoticed that some neurons have larger receptive fields, and they react to more com\u2010\nplex patterns that are combinations of the lower-level patterns. These observations\nled to the idea that the higher-level neurons are based on the outputs of neighboring\nlower-level neurons (in Figure 14-1, notice that each neuron is connected only to a\nfew neurons from the previous layer). This powerful architecture is able to detect all\nsorts of complex patterns in any area of the visual field.\n|\nChapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks\n4 \u201cNeocognitron: A Self-organizing Neural Network Model for a Mechanism of Pattern Recognition Unaffected\nby Shift in Position,\u201d K.

An\nimportant milestone was a 1998 paper5 by Yann LeCun, L\u00e9on Bottou, Yoshua Bengio,\nand Patrick Haffner, which introduced the famous LeNet-5 architecture, widely used\nto recognize handwritten check numbers. This architecture has some building blocks\nthat you already know, such as fully connected layers and sigmoid activation func\u2010\ntions, but it also introduces two new building blocks: convolutional layers and pooling\nlayers. Let\u2019s look at them now.\nWhy not simply use a regular deep neural network with fully con\u2010\nnected layers for image recognition tasks? Unfortunately, although\nthis works fine for small images (e.g., MNIST), it breaks down for\nlarger images because of the huge number of parameters it\nrequires. For example, a 100 \u00d7 100 image has 10,000 pixels, and if\nthe first layer has just 1,000 neurons (which already severely\nrestricts the amount of information transmitted to the next layer),\nthis means a total of 10 million connections.

In turn, each neuron in the second convolutional layer is connected\nonly to neurons located within a small rectangle in the first layer.

This hierarchical structure is common in real-world images, which is one of the\nreasons why CNNs work so well for image recognition.\nFigure 14-2.

The first\nand last elements must currently be equal to 1. They may one day be used to\nspecify a batch stride (to skip some instances) and a channel stride (to skip some\nof the previous layer\u2019s feature maps or channels).\n\u2022 padding must be either \"VALID\" or \"SAME\":\n\u2014 If set to \"VALID\", the convolutional layer does not use zero padding, and may\nignore some rows and columns at the bottom and right of the input image,\ndepending on the stride, as shown in Figure 14-7 (for simplicity, only the hor\u2010\nizontal dimension is shown here, but of course the same logic applies to the\nvertical dimension).\n\u2014 If set to \"SAME\", the convolutional layer uses zero padding if necessary. In this\ncase, the number of output neurons is equal to the number of input neurons\ndivided by the stride, rounded up (in this example, 13 / 5 = 2.6, rounded up to\n3). Then zeros are added as evenly as possible around the inputs.\n|\nChapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks\nFigure 14-7. Padding options\u2014input width: 13, filter width: 6, stride: 5\nIn this example, we manually defined the filters, but in a real CNN you would nor\u2010\nmally define filters as trainable variables, so the neural net can learn which filters\nwork best, as explained earlier. Instead of manually creating the variables, however,\nyou can simply use the keras.layers.Conv2D layer:\nconv = keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, strides=1,\npadding=\"SAME\", activation=\"relu\")\nThis code creates a Conv2D layer with 32 filters, each 3 \u00d7 3, using a stride of 1 (both\nhorizontally and vertically), SAME padding, and applying the ReLU activation func\u2010\ntion to its outputs. As you can see, convolutional layers have quite a few hyperpara\u2010\nmeters: you must choose the number of filters, their height and width, the strides, and\nthe padding type. As always, you can use cross-validation to find the right hyperpara\u2010\nmeter values, but this is very time-consuming. We will discuss common CNN archi\u2010\ntectures later, to give you some idea of what hyperparameter values work best in\npractice.\nConvolutional Layer\n|\n7 A fully connected layer with 150 \u00d7 100 neurons, each connected to all 150 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 3 inputs, would have 1502\n\u00d7 1002 \u00d7 3 = 675 million parameters!\n8 In the international system of units (SI), 1 MB = 1,000 kB = 1,000 \u00d7 1,000 bytes = 1,000 \u00d7 1,000 \u00d7 8 bits.\nRGB image (three channels), then the number of parameters is (5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3 + 1) \u00d7 200\n= 15,200 (the +1 corresponds to the bias terms), which is fairly small compared to a\nfully connected layer.7 However, each of the 200 feature maps contains 150 \u00d7 100 neu\u2010\nrons, and each of these neurons needs to compute a weighted sum of its 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3 =\n75 inputs: that\u2019s a total of 225 million float multiplications. Not as bad as a fully con\u2010\nnected layer, but still quite computationally intensive. Moreover, if the feature maps\nare represented using 32-bit floats, then the convolutional layer\u2019s output will occupy\n200 \u00d7 150 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 32 = 96 million bits (12 MB) of RAM.8 And that\u2019s just for one\ninstance! If a training batch contains 100 instances, then this layer will use up 1.2 GB\nof RAM!\nDuring inference (i.e., when making a prediction for a new instance) the RAM occu\u2010\npied by one layer can be released as soon as the next layer has been computed, so you\nonly need as much RAM as required by two consecutive layers. But during training\neverything computed during the forward pass needs to be preserved for the reverse\npass, so the amount of RAM needed is (at least) the total amount of RAM required by\nall layers.\nIf training crashes because of an out-of-memory error, you can try\nreducing the mini-batch size. Alternatively, you can try reducing\ndimensionality using a stride, or removing a few layers. Or you can\ntry using 16-bit floats instead of 32-bit floats. Or you could distrib\u2010\nute the CNN across multiple devices.\nNow let\u2019s look at the second common building block of CNNs: the pooling layer.",

The first one is represented as a black square with a vertical white line in\nthe middle (it is a 7 \u00d7 7 matrix full of 0s except for the central column, which is full of\n1s); neurons using these weights will ignore everything in their receptive field except\nfor the central vertical line (since all inputs will get multiplied by 0, except for the\nones located in the central vertical line). The second filter is a black square with a\nhorizontal white line in the middle. Once again, neurons using these weights will\nignore everything in their receptive field except for the central horizontal line.\nNow if all neurons in a layer use the same vertical line filter (and the same bias term),\nand you feed the network the input image shown in Figure 14-5 (bottom image), the\nlayer will output the top-left image.

Similarly, the upper-right image is what you get if all neu\u2010\nrons use the same horizontal line filter; notice that the horizontal white lines get\nenhanced while the rest is blurred out.

A mini-batch is represented as a 4D tensor of shape\n[mini-batch size, height, width, channels]. The weights of a convolutional\nlayer are represented as a 4D tensor of shape [fh, fw, fn\u2032, fn]. The bias terms of a convo\u2010\nlutional layer are simply represented as a 1D tensor of shape [fn].\nLet\u2019s look at a simple example. The following code loads two sample images, using\nScikit-Learn\u2019s load_sample_images() (which loads two color images, one of a Chi\u2010\nnese temple, and the other of a flower). The pixel intensities (for each color channel)\nis represented as a byte from 0 to 255, so we scale these features simply by dividing by\n255, to get floats ranging from 0 to 1. Then we create two 7 \u00d7 7 filters (one with a\nvertical white line in the middle, and the other with a horizontal white line in the\nmiddle), and we apply them to both images using the tf.nn.conv2d() function,\nwhich is part of TensorFlow\u2019s low-level Deep Learning API. In this example, we use\nzero padding (padding=\"SAME\") and a stride of 2. Finally, we plot one of the resulting\nfeature maps (similar to the top-right image in Figure 14-5).\nTensorFlow Implementation\nImplementing a max pooling layer in TensorFlow is quite easy. The following code\ncreates a max pooling layer using a 2 \u00d7 2 kernel. The strides default to the kernel size,\nso this layer will use a stride of 2 (both horizontally and vertically). By default, it uses\nVALID padding (i.e., no padding at all):\nmax_pool = keras.layers.MaxPool2D(pool_size=2)\nTo create an average pooling layer, just use AvgPool2D instead of MaxPool2D. As you\nmight expect, it works exactly like a max pooling layer, except it computes the mean\nrather than the max. Average pooling layers used to be very popular, but people\n|\nChapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks\nmostly use max pooling layers now, as they generally perform better. This may seem\nsurprising, since computing the mean generally loses less information than comput\u2010\ning the max. But on the other hand, max pooling preserves only the strongest feature,\ngetting rid of all the meaningless ones, so the next layers get a cleaner signal to work\nwith. Moreover, max pooling offers stronger translation invariance than average\npooling.\nNote that max pooling and average pooling can be performed along the depth dimen\u2010\nsion rather than the spatial dimensions, although this is not as common. This can\nallow the CNN to learn to be invariant to various features. For example, it could learn\nmultiple filters, each detecting a different rotation of the same pattern, such as hand-\nwritten digits (see Figure 14-10), and the depth-wise max pooling layer would ensure\nthat the output is the same regardless of the rotation. The CNN could similarly learn\nto be invariant to anything else: thickness, brightness, skew, color, and so on.\nFigure 14-10. Depth-wise max pooling can help the CNN learn any invariance",

Their goal is to subsample (i.e., shrink) the input image in order to\nreduce the computational load, the memory usage, and the number of parameters\n(thereby limiting the risk of overfitting).\nJust like in convolutional layers, each neuron in a pooling layer is connected to the\noutputs of a limited number of neurons in the previous layer, located within a small\nrectangular receptive field. You must define its size, the stride, and the padding type,\njust like before. However, a pooling neuron has no weights; all it does is aggregate the\ninputs using an aggregation function such as the max or mean. Figure 14-8 shows a\nmax pooling layer, which is the most common type of pooling layer. In this example,\n|\nChapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks\n9 Other kernels we discussed so far had weights, but pooling kernels do not: they are just stateless sliding win\u2010\ndows.\nwe use a 2 \u00d7 2 _pooling kernel_9, with a stride of 2, and no padding. Only the max\ninput value in each receptive field makes it to the next layer, while the other inputs\nare dropped. For example, in the lower left receptive field in Figure 14-8, the input\nvalues are 1, 5, 3, 2, so only the max value, 5, is propagated to the next layer. Because\nof the stride of 2, the output image has half the height and half the width of the input\nimage (rounded down since we use no padding).\nFigure 14-8. Max pooling layer (2 \u00d7 2 pooling kernel, stride 2, no padding)\nA pooling layer typically works on every input channel independ\u2010\nently, so the output depth is the same as the input depth.\nOther than reducing computations, memory usage and the number of parameters, a\nmax pooling layer also introduces some level of invariance to small translations, as\nshown in Figure 14-9. Here we assume that the bright pixels have a lower value than\ndark pixels, and we consider 3 images (A, B, C) going through a max pooling layer\nwith a 2 \u00d7 2 kernel and stride 2. Images B and C are the same as image A, but shifted\nby one and two pixels to the right. As you can see, the outputs of the max pooling\nlayer for images A and B are identical. This is what translation invariance means.\nHowever, for image C, the output is different: it is shifted by one pixel to the right\n(but there is still 75% invariance). By inserting a max pooling layer every few layers in\na CNN, it is possible to get some level of translation invariance at a larger scale.\nMoreover, max pooling also offers a small amount of rotational invariance and a\nslight scale invariance. Such invariance (even if it is limited) can be useful in cases\nwhere the prediction should not depend on these details, such as in classification\ntasks.\nPooling Layer\n|\nFigure 14-9. Invariance to small translations\nBut max pooling has some downsides: firstly, it is obviously very destructive: even\nwith a tiny 2 \u00d7 2 kernel and a stride of 2, the output will be two times smaller in both\ndirections (so its area will be four times smaller), simply dropping 75% of the input\nvalues. And in some applications, invariance is not desirable, for example for seman\u2010\ntic segmentation: this is the task of classifying each pixel in an image depending on the\nobject that pixel belongs to: obviously, if the input image is translated by 1 pixel to the\nright, the output should also be translated by 1 pixel to the right. The goal in this case\nis equivariance, not invariance: a small change to the inputs should lead to a corre\u2010\nsponding small change in the output.\nPooling Layer\n|\nKeras does not include a depth-wise max pooling layer, but TensorFlow\u2019s low-level\nDeep Learning API does: just use the tf.nn.max_pool() function, and specify the\nkernel size and strides as 4-tuples. The first three values of each should be 1: this indi\u2010\ncates that the kernel size and stride along the batch, height and width dimensions\nshoud be 1. The last value should be whatever kernel size and stride you want along\nthe depth dimension, for example 3 (this must be a divisor of the input depth; for\nexample, it will not work if the previous layer outputs 20 feature maps, since 20 is not\na multiple of 3):\noutput = tf.nn.max_pool(images,\nksize=(1, 1, 1, 3),\nstrides=(1, 1, 1, 3),\npadding=\"VALID\")\nIf you want to include this as a layer in your Keras models, you can simply wrap it in\na Lambda layer (or create a custom Keras layer):\ndepth_pool = keras.layers.Lambda(\nlambda X: tf.nn.max_pool(X, ksize=(1, 1, 1, 3), strides=(1, 1, 1, 3),\npadding=\"VALID\"))\nOne last type of pooling layer that you will often see in modern architectures is the\nglobal average pooling layer. It works very differently: all it does is compute the mean\nof each entire feature map (it\u2019s like an average pooling layer using a pooling kernel\nwith the same spatial dimensions as the inputs). This means that it just outputs a sin\u2010\ngle number per feature map and per instance. Although this is of course extremely\ndestructive (most of the information in the feature map is lost), it can be useful as the\noutput layer, as we will see later in this chapter. To create such a layer, simply use the\nkeras.layers.GlobalAvgPool2D class:\nglobal_avg_pool = keras.layers.GlobalAvgPool2D()\nIt is actually equivalent to this simple Lamba layer, which computes the mean over the\nspatial dimensions (height and width):\nglobal_avg_pool = keras.layers.Lambda(lambda X: tf.reduce_mean(X, axis=[1, 2]))\nNow you know all the building blocks to create a convolutional neural network.

One exception to this recommenda\u2010\ntion is for the first convolutional layer: it can typically have a large\nkernel (e.g., 5 \u00d7 5), usually with stride of 2 or more: this will reduce\nthe spatial dimension of the image without losing too much infor\u2010\nmation, and since the input image only has 3 channels in general, it\nwill not be too costly.\nHere is how you can implement a simple CNN to tackle the fashion MNIST dataset\n(introduced in Chapter 10):\nfrom functools import partial\nDefaultConv2D = partial(keras.layers.Conv2D,\nkernel_size=3, activation='relu', padding=\"SAME\")\nmodel = keras.models.Sequential([\nDefaultConv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=7, input_shape=[28, 28, 1]),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=2),\nDefaultConv2D(filters=128),\nDefaultConv2D(filters=128),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=2),\nDefaultConv2D(filters=256),\nDefaultConv2D(filters=256),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=2),\nkeras.layers.Flatten(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(units=128, activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Dropout(0.5),\nkeras.layers.Dense(units=64, activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Dropout(0.5),\nkeras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='softmax'),\n])\nCNN Architectures\n|\n\u2022 In this code, we start by using the partial() function to define a thin wrapper\naround the Conv2D class, called DefaultConv2D: it simply avoids having to repeat\nthe same hyperparameter values over and over again.\n\u2022 The first layer uses a large kernel size, but no stride because the input images are\nnot very large. It also sets input_shape=[28, 28, 1], which means the images\nare 28 \u00d7 28 pixels, with a single color channel (i.e., grayscale).\n\u2022 Next, we have a max pooling layer, which divides each spatial dimension by a fac\u2010\ntor of two (since pool_size=2).\n\u2022 Then we repeat the same structure twice: two convolutional layers followed by a\nmax pooling layer. For larger images, we could repeat this structure several times\n(the number of repetitions is a hyperparameter you can tune).\n\u2022 Note that the number of filters grows as we climb up the CNN towards the out\u2010\nput layer (it is initially 64, then 128, then 256): it makes sense for it to grow, since\nthe number of low level features is often fairly low (e.g., small circles, horizontal\nlines, etc.), but there are many different ways to combine them into higher level\nfeatures. It is a common practice to double the number of filters after each pool\u2010\ning layer: since a pooling layer divides each spatial dimension by a factor of 2, we\ncan afford doubling the number of feature maps in the next layer, without fear of\nexploding the number of parameters, memory usage, or computational load.\n\u2022 Next is the fully connected network, composed of 2 hidden dense layers and a\ndense output layer. Note that we must flatten its inputs, since a dense network\nexpects a 1D array of features for each instance. We also add two dropout layers,\nwith a dropout rate of 50% each, to reduce overfitting.\nThis CNN reaches over 92% accuracy on the test set. It\u2019s not the state of the art, but it\nis pretty good, and clearly much better than what we achieved with dense networks in\nChapter 10.\nOver the years, variants of this fundamental architecture have been developed, lead\u2010\ning to amazing advances in the field. A good measure of this progress is the error rate\nin competitions such as the ILSVRC ImageNet challenge. In this competition the\ntop-5 error rate for image classification fell from over 26% to less than 2.3% in just six\nyears. The top-five error rate is the number of test images for which the system\u2019s top 5\npredictions did not include the correct answer. The images are large (256 pixels high)\nand there are 1,000 classes, some of which are really subtle (try distinguishing 120\ndog breeds). Looking at the evolution of the winning entries is a good way to under\u2010\nstand how CNNs work.\nWe will first look at the classical LeNet-5 architecture (1998), then three of the win\u2010\nners of the ILSVRC challenge: AlexNet (2012), GoogLeNet (2014), and ResNet\n(2015).\n|\nChapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks\n10 \u201cGradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition\u201d\n, Y.

This step can be implemented using the tf.nn.local_response_normaliza\ntion() function (which you can wrap in a Lambda layer if you want to use it in a\nKeras model).\nA variant of AlexNet called ZF Net was developed by Matthew Zeiler and Rob Fergus\nand won the 2013 ILSVRC challenge. It is essentially AlexNet with a few tweaked\nhyperparameters (number of feature maps, kernel size, stride, etc.).\nCNN Architectures\n|\nsingle convolutional layer does), this pair of convolutional layers sweeps a two-\nlayer neural network across the image.\nIn short, you can think of the whole inception module as a convolutional layer on\nsteroids, able to output feature maps that capture complex patterns at various scales.\nThe number of convolutional kernels for each convolutional layer\nis a hyperparameter. Unfortunately, this means that you have six\nmore hyperparameters to tweak for every inception layer you add.\nNow let\u2019s look at the architecture of the GoogLeNet CNN (see Figure 14-14). The\nnumber of feature maps output by each convolutional layer and each pooling layer is\nshown before the kernel size. The architecture is so deep that it has to be represented\nin three columns, but GoogLeNet is actually one tall stack, including nine inception\nmodules (the boxes with the spinning tops). The six numbers in the inception mod\u2010\nules represent the number of feature maps output by each convolutional layer in the\nmodule (in the same order as in Figure 14-13). Note that all the convolutional layers\nuse the ReLU activation function.\n|\nChapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks\nFigure 14-14. GoogLeNet architecture\nLet\u2019s go through this network:\n\u2022 The first two layers divide the image\u2019s height and width by 4 (so its area is divided\nby 16), to reduce the computational load. The first layer uses a large kernel size,\nso that much of the information is still preserved.\n\u2022 Then the local response normalization layer ensures that the previous layers learn\na wide variety of features (as discussed earlier).\n\u2022 Two convolutional layers follow, where the first acts like a bottleneck layer. As\nexplained earlier, you can think of this pair as a single smarter convolutional\nlayer.\n\u2022 Again, a local response normalization layer ensures that the previous layers cap\u2010\nture a wide variety of patterns.\nCNN Architectures\n|\n14 \u201cVery Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition,\u201d K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman\n(2015).\n\u2022 Next a max pooling layer reduces the image height and width by 2, again to speed\nup computations.\n\u2022 Then comes the tall stack of nine inception modules, interleaved with a couple\nmax pooling layers to reduce dimensionality and speed up the net.\n\u2022 Next, the global average pooling layer simply outputs the mean of each feature\nmap: this drops any remaining spatial information, which is fine since there was\nnot much spatial information left at that point. Indeed, GoogLeNet input images\nare typically expected to be 224 \u00d7 224 pixels, so after 5 max pooling layers, each\ndividing the height and width by 2, the feature maps are down to 7 \u00d7 7. More\u2010\nover, it is a classification task, not localization, so it does not matter where the\nobject is. Thanks to the dimensionality reduction brought by this layer, there is\nno need to have several fully connected layers at the top of the CNN (like in\nAlexNet), and this considerably reduces the number of parameters in the net\u2010\nwork and limits the risk of overfitting.\n\u2022 The last layers are self-explanatory: dropout for regularization, then a fully con\u2010\nnected layer with 1,000 units, since there are a 1,000 classes, and a softmax acti\u2010\nvation function to output estimated class probabilities.\nThis diagram is slightly simplified: the original GoogLeNet architecture also included\ntwo auxiliary classifiers plugged on top of the third and sixth inception modules.\nThey were both composed of one average pooling layer, one convolutional layer, two\nfully connected layers, and a softmax activation layer. During training, their loss\n(scaled down by 70%) was added to the overall loss. The goal was to fight the vanish\u2010\ning gradients problem and regularize the network. However, it was later shown that\ntheir effect was relatively minor.\nSeveral variants of the GoogLeNet architecture were later proposed by Google\nresearchers, including Inception-v3 and Inception-v4, using slightly different incep\u2010\ntion modules, and reaching even better performance.\nCNN Architectures\n|\nFigure 14-16. Regular deep neural network (left) and deep residual network (right)\nNow let\u2019s look at ResNet\u2019s architecture (see Figure 14-17). It is actually surprisingly\nsimple. It starts and ends exactly like GoogLeNet (except without a dropout layer),\nand in between is just a very deep stack of simple residual units. Each residual unit is\ncomposed of two convolutional layers (and no pooling layer!), with Batch Normaliza\u2010\ntion (BN) and ReLU activation, using 3 \u00d7 3 kernels and preserving spatial dimensions\n(stride 1, SAME padding).\nFigure 14-17. ResNet architecture\nNote that the number of feature maps is doubled every few residual units, at the same\ntime as their height and width are halved (using a convolutional layer with stride 2).\nWhen this happens the inputs cannot be added directly to the outputs of the residual\nunit since they don\u2019t have the same shape (for example, this problem affects the skip\n|\nChapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks\n16 \u201cInception-v4, Inception-ResNet and the Impact of Residual Connections on Learning,\u201d C.

To solve this problem,\nthe inputs are passed through a 1 \u00d7 1 convolutional layer with stride 2 and the right\nnumber of output feature maps (see Figure 14-18).\nFigure 14-18. Skip connection when changing feature map size and depth\nResNet-34 is the ResNet with 34 layers (only counting the convolutional layers and\nthe fully connected layer) containing three residual units that output 64 feature maps,\n4 RUs with 128 maps, 6 RUs with 256 maps, and 3 RUs with 512 maps. We will imple\u2010\nment this architecture later in this chapter.\nResNets deeper than that, such as ResNet-152, use slightly different residual units.\nInstead of two 3 \u00d7 3 convolutional layers with (say) 256 feature maps, they use three\nconvolutional layers: first a 1 \u00d7 1 convolutional layer with just 64 feature maps (4\ntimes less), which acts as a bottleneck layer (as discussed already), then a 3 \u00d7 3 layer\nwith 64 feature maps, and finally another 1 \u00d7 1 convolutional layer with 256 feature\nmaps (4 times 64) that restores the original depth. ResNet-152 contains three such\nRUs that output 256 maps, then 8 RUs with 512 maps, a whopping 36 RUs with 1,024\nmaps, and finally 3 RUs with 2,048 maps.\nGoogle\u2019s Inception-v416 architecture merged the ideas of GoogLe\u2010\nNet and ResNet and achieved close to 3% top-5 error rate on\nImageNet classification.\nCNN Architectures\n|\n18 This name can sometimes be ambiguous, since spatially separable convolutions are often called \u201cseparable\nconvolutions\u201d as well.\nauthor of Keras), and it significantly outperformed Inception-v3 on a huge vision task\n(350 million images and 17,000 classes). Just like Inception-v4, it also merges the\nideas of GoogLeNet and ResNet, but it replaces the inception modules with a special\ntype of layer called a depthwise separable convolution (or separable convolution for\nshort18). These layers had been used before in some CNN architectures, but they were\nnot as central as in the Xception architecture. While a regular convolutional layer\nuses filters that try to simultaneously capture spatial patterns (e.g., an oval) and cross-\nchannel patterns (e.g., mouth + nose + eyes = face), a separable convolutional layer\nmakes the strong assumption that spatial patterns and cross-channel patterns can be\nmodeled separately (see Figure 14-19). Thus, it is composed of two parts: the first part\napplies a single spatial filter for each input feature map, then the second part looks\nexclusively for cross-channel patterns\u2014it is just a regular convolutional layer with 1 \u00d7\n1 filters.\nFigure 14-19. Depthwise Separable Convolutional Layer\nSince separable convolutional layers only have one spatial filter per input channel,\nyou should avoid using them after layers that have too few channels, such as the input\nlayer (granted, that\u2019s what Figure 14-19 represents, but it is just for illustration pur\u2010\nposes). For this reason, the Xception architecture starts with 2 regular convolutional\nlayers, but then the rest of the architecture uses only separable convolutions (34 in\n|\nChapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks\n19 \u201cCrafting GBD-Net for Object Detection,\u201d X. Zeng et al. (2016).\n20 \u201cSqueeze-and-Excitation Networks,\u201d Jie Hu et al. (2017)\nall), plus a few max pooling layers and the usual final layers (a global average pooling\nlayer, and a dense output layer).\nYou might wonder why Xception is considered a variant of GoogLeNet, since it con\u2010\ntains no inception module at all? Well, as we discussed earlier, an Inception module\ncontains convolutional layers with 1 \u00d7 1 filters: these look exclusively for cross-\nchannel patterns. However, the convolution layers that sit on top of them are regular\nconvolutional layers that look both for spatial and cross-channel patterns. So you can\nthink of an Inception module as an intermediate between a regular convolutional\nlayer (which considers spatial patterns and cross-channel patterns jointly) and a sepa\u2010\nrable convolutional layer (which considers them separately). In practice, it seems that\nseparable convolutions generally perform better.\nSeparable convolutions use less parameters, less memory and less\ncomputations than regular convolutional layers, and in general\nthey even perform better, so you should consider using them by\ndefault (except after layers with few channels).\nThe ILSVRC 2016 challenge was won by the CUImage team from the Chinese Uni\u2010\nversity of Hong Kong. They used an ensemble of many different techniques, includ\u2010\ning a sophisticated object-detection system called GBD-Net19, to achieve a top-5 error\nrate below 3%. Although this result is unquestionably impressive, the complexity of\nthe solution contrasted with the simplicity of ResNets. Moreover, one year later\nanother fairly simple architecture performed even better, as we will see now.\nCNN Architectures\n|\nFigure 14-20. SE-Inception Module (left) and SE-ResNet Unit (right)\nA SE Block analyzes the output of the unit it is attached to, focusing exclusively on\nthe depth dimension (it does not look for any spatial pattern), and it learns which fea\u2010\ntures are usually most active together. It then uses this information to recalibrate the\nfeature maps, as shown in Figure 14-21. For example, a SE Block may learn that\nmouths, noses and eyes usually appear together in pictures: if you see a mouth and a\nnose, you should expect to see eyes as well. So if a SE Block sees a strong activation in\nthe mouth and nose feature maps, but only mild activation in the eye feature map, it\nwill boost the eye feature map (more accurately, it will reduce irrelevant feature\nmaps). If the eyes were somewhat confused with something else, this feature map\nrecalibration will help resolve the ambiguity.\n|\nChapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks\nFigure 14-21. An SE Block Performs Feature Map Recalibration\nA SE Block is composed of just 3 layers: a global average pooling layer, a hidden dense\nlayer using the ReLU activation function, and a dense output layer using the sigmoid\nactivation function (see Figure 14-22):\nFigure 14-22. SE Block Architecture\nCNN Architectures\n|\nAs earlier, the global average pooling layer computes the mean activation for each fea\u2010\nture map: for example, if its input contains 256 feature maps, it will output 256 num\u2010\nbers representing the overall level of response for each filter. The next layer is where\nthe \u201csqueeze\u201d happens: this layer has much less than 256 neurons, typically 16 times\nless than the number of feature maps (e.g., 16 neurons), so the 256 numbers get com\u2010\npressed into a small vector (e.g., 16 dimensional). This is a low-dimensional vector\nrepresentation (i.e., an embedding) of the distribution of feature responses. This bot\u2010\ntleneck step forces the SE Block to learn a general representation of the feature com\u2010\nbinations (we will see this principle in action again when we discuss autoencoders\nin ???). Finally, the output layer takes the embedding and outputs a recalibration vec\u2010\ntor containing one number per feature map (e.g., 256), each between 0 and 1. The\nfeature maps are then multiplied by this recalibration vector, so irrelevant features\n(with a low recalibration score) get scaled down while relevant features (with a recali\u2010\nbration score close to 1) are left alone.",

This reduces overfitting, making this\na regularization technique. The generated instances should be as realistic as possible:\n|\nChapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks\nideally, given an image from the augmented training set, a human should not be able\nto tell whether it was augmented or not. Moreover, simply adding white noise will not\nhelp; the modifications should be learnable (white noise is not).\nFor example, you can slightly shift, rotate, and resize every picture in the training set\nby various amounts and add the resulting pictures to the training set (see\nFigure 14-12). This forces the model to be more tolerant to variations in the position,\norientation, and size of the objects in the pictures. If you want the model to be more\ntolerant to different lighting conditions, you can similarly generate many images with\nvarious contrasts. In general, you can also flip the pictures horizontally (except for\ntext, and other non-symmetrical objects). By combining these transformations you\ncan greatly increase the size of your training set.\nFigure 14-12.

The notation \u201c3 \u00d7 3 +\n1(S)\u201d means that the layer uses a 3 \u00d7 3 kernel, stride 1, and SAME padding. The input\nsignal is first copied and fed to four different layers. All convolutional layers use the\nReLU activation function. Note that the second set of convolutional layers uses differ\u2010\nent kernel sizes (1 \u00d7 1, 3 \u00d7 3, and 5 \u00d7 5), allowing them to capture patterns at different\nscales. Also note that every single layer uses a stride of 1 and SAME padding (even\nthe max pooling layer), so their outputs all have the same height and width as their\ninputs. This makes it possible to concatenate all the outputs along the depth dimen\u2010\nsion in the final depth concat layer (i.e., stack the feature maps from all four top con\u2010\nvolutional layers). This concatenation layer can be implemented in TensorFlow using\nthe tf.concat() operation, with axis=3 (axis 3 is the depth).\nFigure 14-13. Inception module\nYou may wonder why inception modules have convolutional layers with 1 \u00d7 1 ker\u2010\nnels. Surely these layers cannot capture any features since they look at only one pixel\nat a time? In fact, these layers serve three purposes:\n\u2022 First, although they cannot capture spatial patterns, they can capture patterns\nalong the depth dimension.\n\u2022 Second, they are configured to output fewer feature maps than their inputs, so\nthey serve as bottleneck layers, meaning they reduce dimensionality. This cuts the\ncomputational cost and the number of parameters, speeding up training and\nimproving generalization.\n\u2022 Lastly, each pair of convolutional layers ([1 \u00d7 1, 3 \u00d7 3] and [1 \u00d7 1, 5 \u00d7 5]) acts like\na single, powerful convolutional layer, capable of capturing more complex pat\u2010\nterns.

It confirmed the general\ntrend: models are getting deeper and deeper, with fewer and fewer parameters. The\nkey to being able to train such a deep network is to use skip connections (also called\nshortcut connections): the signal feeding into a layer is also added to the output of a\nlayer located a bit higher up the stack. Let\u2019s see why this is useful.\nWhen training a neural network, the goal is to make it model a target function h(x).\nIf you add the input x to the output of the network (i.e., you add a skip connection),\nthen the network will be forced to model f(x) = h(x) \u2013 x rather than h(x). This is\ncalled residual learning (see Figure 14-15).\nFigure 14-15. Residual learning\nWhen you initialize a regular neural network, its weights are close to zero, so the net\u2010\nwork just outputs values close to zero. If you add a skip connection, the resulting net\u2010\nwork just outputs a copy of its inputs; in other words, it initially models the identity\nfunction. If the target function is fairly close to the identity function (which is often\nthe case), this will speed up training considerably.\nMoreover, if you add many skip connections, the network can start making progress\neven if several layers have not started learning yet (see Figure 14-16). Thanks to skip\nconnections, the signal can easily make its way across the whole network. The deep\nresidual network can be seen as a stack of residual units, where each residual unit is a\nsmall neural network with a skip connection.",

To\nillustrate the process, let\u2019s implement a ResNet-34 from scratch using Keras. First, let\u2019s\ncreate a ResidualUnit layer:\nDefaultConv2D = partial(keras.layers.Conv2D, kernel_size=3, strides=1,\npadding=\"SAME\", use_bias=False)\nclass ResidualUnit(keras.layers.Layer):\ndef __init__(self, filters, strides=1, activation=\"relu\", **kwargs):\nsuper().__init__(**kwargs)\nself.activation = keras.activations.get(activation)\nself.main_layers = [\nDefaultConv2D(filters, strides=strides),\nkeras.layers.BatchNormalization(),\nself.activation,\nDefaultConv2D(filters),\nkeras.layers.BatchNormalization()]\nself.skip_layers = []\nif strides > 1:\nself.skip_layers = [\nDefaultConv2D(filters, kernel_size=1, strides=strides),\nkeras.layers.BatchNormalization()]\ndef call(self, inputs):\nZ = inputs\nfor layer in self.main_layers:\nZ = layer(Z)\nskip_Z = inputs\nfor layer in self.skip_layers:\n|\nChapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks\nskip_Z = layer(skip_Z)\nreturn self.activation(Z + skip_Z)\nAs you can see, this code matches Figure 14-18 pretty closely. In the constructor, we\ncreate all the layers we will need: the main layers are the ones on the right side of the\ndiagram, and the skip layers are the ones on the left (only needed if the stride is\ngreater than 1). Then in the call() method, we simply make the inputs go through\nthe main layers, and the skip layers (if any), then we add both outputs and we apply\nthe activation function.\nNext, we can build the ResNet-34 simply using a Sequential model, since it is really\njust a long sequence of layers (we can treat each residual unit as a single layer now\nthat we have the ResidualUnit class):\nmodel = keras.models.Sequential()\nmodel.add(DefaultConv2D(64, kernel_size=7, strides=2,\ninput_shape=[224, 224, 3]))\nmodel.add(keras.layers.BatchNormalization())\nmodel.add(keras.layers.Activation(\"relu\"))\nmodel.add(keras.layers.MaxPool2D(pool_size=3, strides=2, padding=\"SAME\"))\nprev_filters = 64\nfor filters in [64] * 3 + [128] * 4 + [256] * 6 + [512] * 3:\nstrides = 1 if filters == prev_filters else 2\nmodel.add(ResidualUnit(filters, strides=strides))\nprev_filters = filters\nmodel.add(keras.layers.GlobalAvgPool2D())\nmodel.add(keras.layers.Flatten())\nmodel.add(keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=\"softmax\"))\nThe only slightly tricky part in this code is the loop that adds the ResidualUnit layers\nto the model: as explained earlier, the first 3 RUs have 64 filters, then the next 4 RUs\nhave 128 filters, and so on. We then set the strides to 1 when the number of filters is\nthe same as in the previous RU, or else we set it to 2. Then we add the ResidualUnit,\nand finally we update prev_filters.\nIt is quite amazing that in less than 40 lines of code, we can build the model that won\nthe ILSVRC 2015 challenge! It demonstrates both the elegance of the ResNet model,\nand the expressiveness of the Keras API. Implementing the other CNN architectures\nis not much harder. However, Keras comes with several of these architectures built in,\nso why not use them instead?",

For example:\nmodel = keras.applications.resnet50.ResNet50(weights=\"imagenet\")\nUsing Pretrained Models From Keras\n|\n21 In the ImageNet dataset, each image is associated to a word in the WordNet dataset: the class ID is just a\nWordNet ID.\nThat\u2019s all! This will create a ResNet-50 model and download weights pretrained on\nthe ImageNet dataset. To use it, you first need to ensure that the images have the right\nsize. A ResNet-50 model expects 224 \u00d7 224 images (other models may expect other\nsizes, such as 299 \u00d7 299), so let\u2019s use TensorFlow\u2019s tf.image.resize() function to\nresize the images we loaded earlier:\nimages_resized = tf.image.resize(images, [224, 224])\nThe tf.image.resize() will not preserve the aspect ratio. If this is\na problem, you can try cropping the images to the appropriate\naspect ratio before resizing. Both operations can be done in one\nshot with tf.image.crop_and_resize().\nThe pretrained models assume that the images are preprocessed in a specific way. In\nsome cases they may expect the inputs to be scaled from 0 to 1, or -1 to 1, and so on.\nEach model provides a preprocess_input() function that you can use to preprocess\nyour images. These functions assume that the pixel values range from 0 to 255, so we\nmust multiply them by 255 (since earlier we scaled them to the 0\u20131 range):\ninputs = keras.applications.resnet50.preprocess_input(images_resized * 255)\nNow we can use the pretrained model to make predictions:\nY_proba = model.predict(inputs)\nAs usual, the output Y_proba is a matrix with one row per image and one column per\nclass (in this case, there are 1,000 classes). If you want to display the top K predic\u2010\ntions, including the class name and the estimated probability of each predicted class,\nyou can use the decode_predictions() function. For each image, it returns an array\ncontaining the top K predictions, where each prediction is represented as an array\ncontaining the class identifier21, its name and the corresponding confidence score:\ntop_K = keras.applications.resnet50.decode_predictions(Y_proba, top=3)\nfor image_index in range(len(images)):\nprint(\"Image #{}\".format(image_index))\nfor class_id, name, y_proba in top_K[image_index]:\nprint(\"  {} - {:12s} {:.2f}%\".format(class_id, name, y_proba * 100))\nprint()\nThe output looks like this:\nImage #0\nn03877845 - palace       42.87%\nn02825657 - bell_cote    40.57%\nn03781244 - monastery    14.56%\n|\nChapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks\nImage #1\nn04522168 - vase         46.83%\nn07930864 - cup          7.78%\nn11939491 - daisy        4.87%\nThe correct classes (monastery and daisy) appear in the top 3 results for both images.\nThat\u2019s pretty good considering that the model had to choose among 1,000 classes.\nAs you can see, it is very easy to create a pretty good image classifier using a pre\u2010\ntrained model.

For example, let\u2019s train a model to classify pictures of flowers,\nreusing a pretrained Xception model. First, let\u2019s load the dataset using TensorFlow\nDatasets (see Chapter 13):\nimport tensorflow_datasets as tfds\ndataset, info = tfds.load(\"tf_flowers\", as_supervised=True, with_info=True)\ndataset_size = info.splits[\"train\"].num_examples # 3670\nclass_names = info.features[\"label\"].names # [\"dandelion\", \"daisy\", ...]\nn_classes = info.features[\"label\"].num_classes # 5\nNote that you can get information about the dataset by setting with_info=True. Here,\nwe get the dataset size and the names of the classes. Unfortunately, there is only a\n\"train\" dataset, no test set or validation set, so we need to split the training set. The\nTF Datasets project provides an API for this. For example, let\u2019s take the first 10% of\nthe dataset for testing, the next 15% for validation, and the remaining 75% for train\u2010\ning:\ntest_split, valid_split, train_split = tfds.Split.TRAIN.subsplit([10, 15, 75])\ntest_set = tfds.load(\"tf_flowers\", split=test_split, as_supervised=True)\nvalid_set = tfds.load(\"tf_flowers\", split=valid_split, as_supervised=True)\ntrain_set = tfds.load(\"tf_flowers\", split=train_split, as_supervised=True)\nPretrained Models for Transfer Learning\n|\nNext we must preprocess the images. The CNN expects 224 \u00d7 224 images, so we need\nto resize them. We also need to run the image through Xception\u2019s prepro\ncess_input() function:\ndef preprocess(image, label):\nresized_image = tf.image.resize(image, [224, 224])\nfinal_image = keras.applications.xception.preprocess_input(resized_image)\nreturn final_image, label\nLet\u2019s apply this preprocessing function to all 3 datasets, and let\u2019s also shuffle & repeat\nthe training set, and add batching & prefetching to all datasets:\nbatch_size = 32\ntrain_set = train_set.shuffle(1000).repeat()\ntrain_set = train_set.map(preprocess).batch(batch_size).prefetch(1)\nvalid_set = valid_set.map(preprocess).batch(batch_size).prefetch(1)\ntest_set = test_set.map(preprocess).batch(batch_size).prefetch(1)\nIf you want to perform some data augmentation, you can just change the preprocess\u2010\ning function for the training set, adding some random transformations to the training\nimages. For example, use tf.image.random_crop() to randomly crop the images, use\ntf.image.random_flip_left_right() to randomly flip the images horizontally, and\nso on (see the notebook for an example).\nNext let\u2019s load an Xception model, pretrained on ImageNet. We exclude the top of the\nnetwork (by setting include_top=False): this excludes the global average pooling\nlayer and the dense output layer. We then add our own global average pooling layer,\nbased on the output of the base model, followed by a dense output layer with 1 unit\nper class, using the softmax activation function. Finally, we create the Keras Model:\nbase_model = keras.applications.xception.Xception(weights=\"imagenet\",\ninclude_top=False)\navg = keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(base_model.output)\noutput = keras.layers.Dense(n_classes, activation=\"softmax\")(avg)\nmodel = keras.models.Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=output)\nAs explained in Chapter 11, it\u2019s usually a good idea to freeze the weights of the pre\u2010\ntrained layers, at least at the beginning of training:\nfor layer in base_model.layers:\nlayer.trainable = False\nSince our model uses the base model\u2019s layers directly, rather than\nthe base_model object itself, setting base_model.trainable=False\nwould have no effect.\nFinally, we can compile the model and start training:\n|\nChapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks\noptimizer = keras.optimizers.SGD(lr=0.2, momentum=0.9, decay=0.01)\nmodel.compile(loss=\"sparse_categorical_crossentropy\", optimizer=optimizer,\nmetrics=[\"accuracy\"])\nhistory = model.fit(train_set,\nsteps_per_epoch=int(0.75 * dataset_size / batch_size),\nvalidation_data=valid_set,\nvalidation_steps=int(0.15 * dataset_size / batch_size),\nepochs=5)\nThis will be very slow, unless you have a GPU. If you do not, then\nyou should run this chapter\u2019s notebook in Colab, using a GPU run\u2010\ntime (it\u2019s free!). See the instructions at https://github.com/ageron/\nhandson-ml2.\nAfter training the model for a few epochs, its validation accuracy should reach about\n75-80%, and stop making much progress. This means that the top layers are now\npretty well trained, so we are ready to unfreeze all layers (or you could try unfreezing\njust the top ones), and continue training (don\u2019t forget to compile the model when you\nfreeze or unfreeze layers). This time we use a much lower learning rate to avoid dam\u2010\naging the pretrained weights:\nfor layer in base_model.layers:\nlayer.trainable = True\noptimizer = keras.optimizers.SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.9, decay=0.001)\nmodel.compile(...)\nhistory = model.fit(...)\nIt will take a while, but this model should reach around 95% accuracy on the test set.\nWith that, you can start training amazing image classifiers!

So we need to add them ourselves. This is often one of the hard\u2010\nest and most costly part of a Machine Learning project: getting the labels. It\u2019s a good\nidea to spend time looking for the right tools. To annotate images with bounding\nboxes, you may want to use an open source image labeling tool like VGG Image\nAnnotator, LabelImg, OpenLabeler or ImgLab, or perhaps a commercial tool like\nLabelBox or Supervisely. You may also want to consider crowdsourcing platforms\nsuch as Amazon Mechanical Turk or CrowdFlower if you have a very large number of\nimages to annotate. However, it is quite a lot of work to setup a crowdsourcing plat\u2010\nform, prepare the form to be sent to the workers, to supervise them and ensure the\nquality of the bounding boxes they produce is good, so make sure it is worth the\neffort: if there are just a few thousand images to label, and you don\u2019t plan to do this\nfrequently, it may be preferable to do it yourself. Adriana Kovashka et al. wrote a very\npractical paper22 about crowdsourcing in Computer Vision, I recommend you check\nit out, even if you do not plan to use crowdsourcing.\nSo let\u2019s suppose you obtained the bounding boxes for every image in the flowers data\u2010\nset (for now we will assume there is a single bounding box per image), you then need\nto create a dataset whose items will be batches of preprocessed images along with\ntheir class labels and their bounding boxes. Each item should be a tuple of the form:\n(images, (class_labels, bounding_boxes)). Then you are ready to train your\nmodel!\nThe bounding boxes should be normalized so that the horizontal\nand vertical coordinates, as well as the height and width all range\nfrom 0 to 1. Also, it is common to predict the square root of the\nheight and width rather than the height and width directly: this\nway, a 10 pixel error for a large bounding box will not be penalized\nas much as a 10 pixel error for a small bounding box.\nThe MSE often works fairly well as a cost function to train the model, but it is not a\ngreat metric to evaluate how well the model can predict bounding boxes. The most\ncommon metric for this is the Intersection over Union (IoU): it is the area of overlap\nbetween the predicted bounding box and the target bounding box, divided by the\n|\nChapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks\narea of their union (see Figure 14-23). In tf.keras, it is implemented by the\ntf.keras.metrics.MeanIoU class.\nFigure 14-23.

When the\nCNN was looking at the top left of the image, it detected part of the left-most rose,\nand then it detected that same rose again when it was first shifted one step to the\nright. At the next step, it started detecting part of the top-most rose, and then it detec\u2010\nted it again once it was shifted one more step to the right. You would then continue to\nslide the CNN through the whole image, looking at all 3 \u00d7 3 regions. Moreover, since\nobjects can have varying sizes, you would also slide the CNN across regions of differ\u2010\nent sizes. For example, once you are done with the 3 \u00d7 3 regions, you might want to\nslide the CNN across all 4 \u00d7 4 regions as well.\nObject Detection\n|\nFigure 14-24. Detecting Multiple Objects by Sliding a CNN Across the Image\nThis technique is fairly straightforward, but as you can see it will detect the same\nobject multiple times, at slightly different positions. Some post-processing will then\nbe needed to get rid of all the unnecessary bounding boxes. A common approach for\nthis is called non-max suppression:\n\u2022 First, you need to add an extra objectness output to your CNN, to estimate the\nprobability that a flower is indeed present in the image (alternatively, you could\nadd a \u201cno-flower\u201d class, but this usually does not work as well). It must use the\nsigmoid activation function and you can train it using the \"binary_crossen\ntropy\" loss. Then just get rid of all the bounding boxes for which the objectness\nscore is below some threshold: this will drop all the bounding boxes that don\u2019t\nactually contain a flower.\n\u2022 Second, find the bounding box with the highest objectness score, and get rid of\nall the other bounding boxes that overlap a lot with it (e.g., with an IoU greater\nthan 60%). For example, in Figure 14-24, the bounding box with the max object\u2010\nness score is the thick bounding box over the top-most rose (the objectness score\nis represented by the thickness of the bounding boxes). The other bounding box\nover that same rose overlaps a lot with the max bounding box, so we will get rid\nof it.\n|\nChapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks\n23 \u201cFully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation,\u201d J. Long, E. Shelhamer, T. Darrell (2015).\n24 There is one small exception: a convolutional layer using VALID padding will complain if the input size is\nsmaller than the kernel size.\n\u2022 Third, repeat step two until there are no more bounding boxes to get rid of.\nThis simple approach to object detection works pretty well, but it requires running\nthe CNN many times, so it is quite slow. Fortunately, there is a much faster way to\nslide a CNN across an image: using a Fully Convolutional Network.\nObject Detection\n|\n25 This assumes we used only SAME padding in the network: indeed, VALID padding would reduce the size of\nthe feature maps. Moreover, 448 can be neatly divided by 2 several times until we reach 7, without any round\u2010\ning error. If any layer uses a different stride than 1 or 2, then there may be some rounding error, so again the\nfeature maps may end up being smaller.\nFor example, suppose we already trained a CNN for flower classification and localiza\u2010\ntion. It was trained on 224 \u00d7 224 images and it outputs 10 numbers: outputs 0 to 4 are\nsent through the softmax activation function, and this gives the class probabilities\n(one per class); output 5 is sent through the logistic activation function, and this gives\nthe objectness score; outputs 6 to 9 do not use any activation function, and they rep\u2010\nresent the bounding box\u2019s center coordinates, and its height and width. We can now\nconvert its dense layers to convolutional layers. In fact, we don\u2019t even need to retrain\nit, we can just copy the weights from the dense layers to the convolutional layers!\nAlternatively, we could have converted the CNN into an FCN before training.\nNow suppose the last convolutional layer before the output layer (also called the bot\u2010\ntleneck layer) outputs 7 \u00d7 7 feature maps when the network is fed a 224 \u00d7 224 image\n(see the left side of Figure 14-25). If we feed the FCN a 448 \u00d7 448 image (see the right\nside of Figure 14-25), the bottleneck layer will now output 14 \u00d7 14 feature maps.25\nSince the dense output layer was replaced by a convolutional layer using 10 filters of\nsize 7 \u00d7 7, VALID padding and stride 1, the output will be composed of 10 features\nmaps, each of size 8 \u00d7 8 (since 14 - 7 + 1 = 8). In other words, the FCN will process\nthe whole image only once and it will output an 8 \u00d7 8 grid where each cell contains 10\nnumbers (5 class probabilities, 1 objectness score and 4 bounding box coordinates).\nIt\u2019s exactly like taking the original CNN and sliding it across the image using 8 steps\nper row and 8 steps per column: to visualize this, imagine chopping the original\nimage into a 14 \u00d7 14 grid, then sliding a 7 \u00d7 7 window across this grid: there will be 8\n\u00d7 8 = 64 possible locations for the window, hence 8 \u00d7 8 predictions. However, the\nFCN approach is much more efficient, since the network only looks at the image\nonce. In fact, You Only Look Once (YOLO) is the name of a very popular object detec\u2010\ntion architecture!\n|\nChapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks\n26 \u201cYou Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection,\u201d J.

Redmon, A. Farhadi (2018).\nFigure 14-25. A Fully Convolutional Network Processing a Small Image (left) and a\nLarge One (right)\nObject Detection\n|\n\u2022 First, it outputs 5 bounding boxes for each grid cell (instead of just 1), and each\nbounding box comes with an objectness score. It also outputs 20 class probabili\u2010\nties per grid cell, as it was trained on the PASCAL VOC dataset, which contains\n20 classes. That\u2019s a total of 45 numbers per grid cell (5 * 4 bounding box coordi\u2010\nnates, plus 5 objectness scores, plus 20 class probabilities).\n\u2022 Second, instead of predicting the absolute coordinates of the bounding box cen\u2010\nters, YOLOv3 predicts an offset relative to the coordinates of the grid cell, where\n(0, 0) means the top left of that cell, and (1, 1) means the bottom right. For each\ngrid cell, YOLOv3 is trained to predict only bounding boxes whose center lies in\nthat cell (but the bounding box itself generally extends well beyond the grid cell).\nYOLOv3 applies the logistic activation function to the bounding box coordinates\nto ensure they remain in the 0 to 1 range.\n\u2022 Third, before training the neural net, YOLOv3 finds 5 representative bounding\nbox dimensions, called anchor boxes (or bounding box priors): it does this by\napplying the K-Means algorithm (see ???) to the height and width of the training\nset bounding boxes. For example, if the training images contain many pedes\u2010\ntrians, then one of the anchor boxes will likely have the dimensions of a typical\npedestrian. Then when the neural net predicts 5 bounding boxes per grid cell, it\nactually predicts how much to rescale each of the anchor boxes. For example,\nsuppose one anchor box is 100 pixels tall and 50 pixels wide, and the network\npredicts, say, a vertical rescaling factor of 1.5 and a horizontal rescaling of 0.9 (for\none of the grid cells), this will result in a predicted bounding box of size 150 \u00d7 45\npixels. To be more precise, for each grid cell and each anchor box, the network\npredicts the log of the vertical and horizontal rescaling factors. Having these pri\u2010\nors makes the network more likely to predict bounding boxes of the appropriate\ndimensions, and it also speeds up training since it will more quickly learn what\nreasonable bounding boxes look like.\n\u2022 Fourth, the network is trained using images of different scales: every few batches\nduring training, the network randomly chooses a new image dimension (from\n330 \u00d7 330 to 608 \u00d7 608 pixels). This allows the network to learn to detect objects\nat different scales. Moreover, it makes it possible to use YOLOv3 at different\nscales: the smaller scale will be less accurate but faster than the larger scale, so\nyou can choose the right tradeoff for your use case.\nThere are a few more innovations you might be interested in, such as the use of skip\nconnections to recover some of the spatial resolution that is lost in the CNN (we will\ndiscuss this shortly when we look at semantic segmentation). Moreover, in the 2016\npaper, the authors introduce the YOLO9000 model that uses hierarchical classifica\u2010\ntion: the model predicts a probability for each node in a visual hierarchy called Word\u2010\nTree. This makes it possible for the network to predict with high confidence that an\nimage represents, say, a dog, even though it is unsure what specific type of dog it is.\n|\nChapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks\nSo I encourage you to go ahead and read all three papers: they are quite pleasant to\nread, and it is an excellent example of how Deep Learning systems can be incremen\u2010\ntally improved.\nMean Average Precision (mAP)\nA very common metric used in object detection tasks is the mean Average Precision\n(mAP). \u201cMean Average\u201d sounds a bit redundant, doesn\u2019t it? To understand this met\u2010\nric, let\u2019s go back to two classification metrics we discussed in Chapter 3: precision and\nrecall. Remember the tradeoff: the higher the recall, the lower the precision. You can\nvisualize this in a Precision/Recall curve (see Figure 3-5). To summarize this curve\ninto a single number, we could compute its Area Under the Curve (AUC). But note\nthat the Precision/Recall curve may contain a few sections where precision actually\ngoes up when recall increases, especially at low recall values (you can see this at the\ntop left of Figure 3-5). This is one of the motivations for the mAP metric.\nSuppose the classifier has a 90% precision at 10% recall, but a 96% precision at 20%\nrecall: there\u2019s really no tradeoff here: it simply makes more sense to use the classifier\nat 20% recall rather than at 10% recall, as you will get both higher recall and higher\nprecision. So instead of looking at the precision at 10% recall, we should really be\nlooking at the maximum precision that the classifier can offer with at least 10% recall.\nIt would be 96%, not 90%. So one way to get a fair idea of the model\u2019s performance is\nto compute the maximum precision you can get with at least 0% recall, then 10%\nrecall, 20%, and so on up to 100%, and then calculate the mean of these maximum\nprecisions. This is called the Average Precision (AP) metric. Now when there are more\nthan 2 classes, we can compute the AP for each class, and then compute the mean AP\n(mAP). That\u2019s it!\nHowever, in an object detection systems, there is an additional level of complexity:\nwhat if the system detected the correct class, but at the wrong location (i.e., the\nbounding box is completely off)? Surely we should not count this as a positive predic\u2010\ntion. So one approach is to define an IOU threshold: for example, we may consider\nthat a prediction is correct only if the IOU is greater than, say, 0.5, and the predicted\nclass is correct. The corresponding mAP is generally noted mAP@0.5 (or mAP@50%,\nor sometimes just AP50). In some competitions (such as the Pascal VOC challenge),\nthis is what is done. In others (such as the COCO competition), the mAP is computed\nfor different IOU thresholds (0.50, 0.55, 0.60, \u2026, 0.95), and the final metric is the\nmean of all these mAPs (noted AP@[.50:.95] or AP@[.50:0.05:.95]). Yes, that\u2019s a mean\nmean average.\nSeveral YOLO implementations built using TensorFlow are available on github, some\nwith pretrained weights. At the time of writing, they are based on TensorFlow 1, but\nby the time you read this, TF 2 implementations will certainly be available. Moreover,\nother object detection models are available in the TensorFlow Models project, many\nObject Detection\n|\n29 \u201cSSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector,\u201d Wei Liu et al.

SSD is also a \u201csingle shot\u201d detection model, quite similar to YOLO, while Faster R-\nCNN is more complex: the image first goes through a CNN, and the output is passed\nto a Region Proposal Network (RPN) which proposes bounding boxes that are most\nlikely to contain an object, and a classifier is run for each bounding box, based on the\ncropped output of the CNN.\nThe choice of detection system depends on many factors: speed, accuracy, available\npretrained models, training time, complexity, etc. The papers contain tables of met\u2010\nrics, but there is quite a lot of variability in the testing environments, and the technol\u2010\nogies evolve so fast that it is difficulty to make a fair comparison that will be useful for\nmost people and remain valid for more than a few months.\nGreat! So we can locate objects by drawing bounding boxes around them. But per\u2010\nhaps you might want to be a bit more precise. Let\u2019s see how to go down to the pixel\nlevel.",

They pointed out that you could replace the\ndense layers at the top of a CNN by convolutional layers. To understand this, let\u2019s look\nat an example: suppose a dense layer with 200 neurons sits on top of a convolutional\nlayer that outputs 100 feature maps, each of size 7 \u00d7 7 (this is the feature map size, not\nthe kernel size). Each neuron will compute a weighted sum of all 100 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 activa\u2010\ntions from the convolutional layer (plus a bias term). Now let\u2019s see what happens if we\nreplace the dense layer with a convolution layer using 200 filters, each 7 \u00d7 7, and with\nVALID padding. This layer will output 200 feature maps, each 1 \u00d7 1 (since the kernel\nis exactly the size of the input feature maps and we are using VALID padding). In\nother words, it will output 200 numbers, just like the dense layer did, and if you look\nclosely at the computations performed by a convolutional layer, you will notice that\nthese numbers will be precisely the same as the dense layer produced. The only differ\u2010\nence is that the dense layer\u2019s output was a tensor of shape [batch size, 200] while the\nconvolutional layer will output a tensor of shape [batch size, 1, 1, 200].\nTo convert a dense layer to a convolutional layer, the number of fil\u2010\nters in the convolutional layer must be equal to the number of units\nin the dense layer, the filter size must be equal to the size of the\ninput feature maps, and you must use VALID padding. The stride\nmay be set to 1 or more, as we will see shortly.\nWhy is this important? Well, while a dense layer expects a specific input size (since it\nhas one weight per input feature), a convolutional layer will happily process images of\nany size24 (however, it does expect its inputs to have a specific number of channels,\nsince each kernel contains a different set of weights for each input channel). Since an\nFCN contains only convolutional layers (and pooling layers, which have the same\nproperty), it can be trained and executed on images of any size!",

Note\nthat different objects of the same class are not distinguished. For example, all the bicy\u2010\ncles on the right side of the segmented image end up as one big lump of pixels. The\nmain difficulty in this task is that when images go through a regular CNN, they grad\u2010\nually lose their spatial resolution (due to the layers with strides greater than 1): so a\nregular CNN may end up knowing that there\u2019s a person in the image, somewhere in\nthe bottom left of the image, but it will not be much more precise than that.\n|\nChapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks\n31 This type of layer is sometimes referred to as a deconvolution layer, but it does not perform what mathemati\u2010\ncians call a deconvolution, so this name should be avoided.\nFigure 14-26. Semantic segmentation\nJust like for object detection, there are many different approaches to tackle this prob\u2010\nlem, some quite complex. However, a fairly simple solution was proposed in the 2015\npaper by Jonathan Long et al. we discussed earlier. They start by taking a pretrained\nCNN and turning into an FCN, as discussed earlier. The CNN applies a stride of 32 to\nthe input image overall (i.e., if you add up all the strides greater than 1), meaning the\nlast layer outputs feature maps that are 32 times smaller than the input image. This is\nclearly too coarse, so they add a single upsampling layer that multiplies the resolution\nby 32. There are several solutions available for upsampling (increasing the size of an\nimage), such as bilinear interpolation, but it only works reasonably well up to \u00d74 or\n\u00d78. Instead, they used a transposed convolutional layer:31 it is equivalent to first\nstretching the image by inserting empty rows and columns (full of zeros), then per\u2010\nforming a regular convolution (see Figure 14-27). Alternatively, some people prefer to\nthink of it as a regular convolutional layer that uses fractional strides (e.g., 1/2 in\nFigure 14-27). The transposed convolutional layer can be initialized to perform some\u2010\nthing close to linear interpolation, but since it is a trainable layer, it will learn to do\nbetter during training.\nSemantic Segmentation\n|\nFigure 14-27. Upsampling Using a Transpose Convolutional Layer\nIn a transposed convolution layer, the stride defines how much the\ninput will be stretched, not the size of the filter steps, so the larger\nthe stride, the larger the output (unlike for convolutional layers or\npooling layers).\nTensorFlow Convolution Operations\nTensorFlow also offers a few other kinds of convolutional layers:\n\u2022 keras.layers.Conv1D creates a convolutional layer for 1D inputs, such as time\nseries or text (sequences of letters or words), as we will see in ???.\n\u2022 keras.layers.Conv3D creates a convolutional layer for 3D inputs, such as 3D\nPET scan.\n\u2022 Setting the dilation_rate hyperparameter of any convolutional layer to a value\nof 2 or more creates an \u00e0-trous convolutional layer (\u201c\u00e0 trous\u201d is French for \u201cwith\nholes\u201d). This is equivalent to using a regular convolutional layer with a filter dila\u2010\nted by inserting rows and columns of zeros (i.e., holes). For example, a 1 \u00d7 3 filter\nequal to [[1,2,3]] may be dilated with a dilation rate of 4, resulting in a dilated\nfilter [[1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3]]. This allows the convolutional layer to\n|\nChapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks\nhave a larger receptive field at no computational price and using no extra param\u2010\neters.\n\u2022 tf.nn.depthwise_conv2d() can be used to create a depthwise convolutional layer\n(but you need to create the variables yourself). It applies every filter to every\nindividual input channel independently. Thus, if there are fn filters and fn\u2032 input\nchannels, then this will output fn \u00d7 fn\u2032 feature maps.\nThis solution is okay, but still too imprecise. To do better, the authors added skip con\u2010\nnections from lower layers: for example, they upsampled the output image by a factor\nof 2 (instead of 32), and they added the output of a lower layer that had this double\nresolution. Then they upsampled the result by a factor of 16, leading to a total upsam\u2010\npling factor of 32 (see Figure 14-28). This recovered some of the spatial resolution\nthat was lost in earlier pooling layers. In their best architecture, they used a second\nsimilar skip connection to recover even finer details from an even lower layer: in\nshort, the output of the original CNN goes through the following extra steps: upscale\n\u00d72, add the output of a lower layer (of the appropriate scale), upscale \u00d72, add the out\u2010\nput of an even lower layer, and finally upscale \u00d78. It is even possible to scale up\nbeyond the size of the original image: this can be used to increase the resolution of an\nimage, which is a technique called super-resolution.\nFigure 14-28. Skip layers recover some spatial resolution from lower layers\nOnce again, many github repositories provide TensorFlow implementations of\nsemantic segmentation (TensorFlow 1 for now), and you will even find a pretrained\ninstance segmentation model in the TensorFlow Models project. Instance segmenta\u2010\ntion is similar to semantic segmentation, but instead of merging all objects of the\nsame class into one big lump, each object is distinguished from the others (e.g., it\nidentifies each individual bicycle). At the present, they provide multiple implementa\u2010\ntions of the Mask R-CNN architecture, which was proposed in a 2017 paper: it\nextends the Faster R-CNN model by additionally producing a pixel-mask for each\nbounding box. So not only do you get a bounding box around each object, with a set\nof estimated class probabilities, you also get a pixel mask that locates pixels in the\nbounding box that belong to the object.\nSemantic Segmentation\n|\n32 \u201cMatrix Capsules with EM Routing,\u201d G.

Fine-tune your model.\n7. Present your solution.\n8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.\n2 The original dataset appeared in R. Kelley Pace and Ronald Barry, \u201cSparse Spatial Autoregressions,\u201d Statistics\n& Probability Letters 33, no. 3 (1997): 291\u2013297.\n3 A piece of information fed to a Machine Learning system is often called a signal in reference to Shannon\u2019s\ninformation theory: you want a high signal/noise ratio.\nfrom this model? This is important because it will determine how you frame the\nproblem, what algorithms you will select, what performance measure you will use to\nevaluate your model, and how much effort you should spend tweaking it.\nYour boss answers that your model\u2019s output (a prediction of a district\u2019s median hous\u2010\ning price) will be fed to another Machine Learning system (see Figure 2-2), along\nwith many other signals.3 This downstream system will determine whether it is worth\ninvesting in a given area or not. Getting this right is critical, as it directly affects reve\u2010\nnue.\nFigure 2-2. A Machine Learning pipeline for real estate investments\nPipelines\nA sequence of data processing components is called a data pipeline. Pipelines are very\ncommon in Machine Learning systems, since there is a lot of data to manipulate and\nmany data transformations to apply.\nComponents typically run asynchronously. Each component pulls in a large amount\nof data, processes it, and spits out the result in another data store, and then some time\nlater the next component in the pipeline pulls this data and spits out its own output,\nand so on. Each component is fairly self-contained: the interface between components\nis simply the data store. This makes the system quite simple to grasp (with the help of\na data flow graph), and different teams can focus on different components. Moreover,\nif a component breaks down, the downstream components can often continue to run\nnormally (at least for a while) by just using the last output from the broken compo\u2010\nnent. This makes the architecture quite robust.\n|\nChapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project\nOn the other hand, a broken component can go unnoticed for some time if proper\nmonitoring is not implemented. The data gets stale and the overall system\u2019s perfor\u2010\nmance drops.\nThe next question to ask is what the current solution looks like (if any). It will often\ngive you a reference performance, as well as insights on how to solve the problem.\nYour boss answers that the district housing prices are currently estimated manually\nby experts: a team gathers up-to-date information about a district, and when they\ncannot get the median housing price, they estimate it using complex rules.\nThis is costly and time-consuming, and their estimates are not great; in cases where\nthey manage to find out the actual median housing price, they often realize that their\nestimates were off by more than 20%. This is why the company thinks that it would\nbe useful to train a model to predict a district\u2019s median housing price given other data\nabout that district. The census data looks like a great dataset to exploit for this pur\u2010\npose, since it includes the median housing prices of thousands of districts, as well as\nother data.\nOkay, with all this information you are now ready to start designing your system.\nFirst, you need to frame the problem: is it supervised, unsupervised, or Reinforce\u2010\nment Learning? Is it a classification task, a regression task, or something else? Should\nyou use batch learning or online learning techniques? Before you read on, pause and\ntry to answer these questions for yourself.\nHave you found the answers? Let\u2019s see: it is clearly a typical supervised learning task\nsince you are given labeled training examples (each instance comes with the expected\noutput, i.e., the district\u2019s median housing price). Moreover, it is also a typical regres\u2010\nsion task, since you are asked to predict a value. More specifically, this is a multiple\nregression problem since the system will use multiple features to make a prediction (it\nwill use the district\u2019s population, the median income, etc.). It is also a univariate\nregression problem since we are only trying to predict a single value for each district.\nIf we were trying to predict multiple values per district, it would be a multivariate\nregression problem. Finally, there is no continuous flow of data coming in the system,\nthere is no particular need to adjust to changing data rapidly, and the data is small\nenough to fit in memory, so plain batch learning should do just fine.\nIf the data was huge, you could either split your batch learning\nwork across multiple servers (using the MapReduce technique), or\nyou could use an online learning technique instead.\nExercises\nUsing this chapter\u2019s housing dataset:\n1. Try a Support Vector Machine regressor (sklearn.svm.SVR), with various hyper\u2010\nparameters such as kernel=\"linear\" (with various values for the C hyperpara\u2010\nmeter) or kernel=\"rbf\" (with various values for the C and gamma\nhyperparameters). Don\u2019t worry about what these hyperparameters mean for now.\nHow does the best SVR predictor perform?\n2. Try replacing GridSearchCV with RandomizedSearchCV.\n3. Try adding a transformer in the preparation pipeline to select only the most\nimportant attributes.\n4. Try creating a single pipeline that does the full data preparation plus the final\nprediction.\n5. Automatically explore some preparation options using GridSearchCV.\nSolutions to these exercises are available in the online Jupyter notebooks at https://\ngithub.com/ageron/handson-ml2.\nExercises\n1. Try to build a classifier for the MNIST dataset that achieves over 97% accuracy\non the test set. Hint: the KNeighborsClassifier works quite well for this task;\nyou just need to find good hyperparameter values (try a grid search on the\nweights and n_neighbors hyperparameters).\n2. Write a function that can shift an MNIST image in any direction (left, right, up,\nor down) by one pixel.5 Then, for each image in the training set, create four shif\u2010\n|\nChapter 3: Classification\nted copies (one per direction) and add them to the training set. Finally, train your\nbest model on this expanded training set and measure its accuracy on the test set.\nYou should observe that your model performs even better now! This technique of\nartificially growing the training set is called data augmentation or training set\nexpansion.\n3. Tackle the Titanic dataset. A great place to start is on Kaggle.\n4. Build a spam classifier (a more challenging exercise):\n\u2022 Download examples of spam and ham from Apache SpamAssassin\u2019s public\ndatasets.\n\u2022 Unzip the datasets and familiarize yourself with the data format.\n\u2022 Split the datasets into a training set and a test set.\n\u2022 Write a data preparation pipeline to convert each email into a feature vector.\nYour preparation pipeline should transform an email into a (sparse) vector\nindicating the presence or absence of each possible word. For example, if all\nemails only ever contain four words, \u201cHello,\u201d \u201chow,\u201d \u201care,\u201d \u201cyou,\u201d then the email\n\u201cHello you Hello Hello you\u201d would be converted into a vector [1, 0, 0, 1]\n(meaning [\u201cHello\u201d is present, \u201chow\u201d is absent, \u201care\u201d is absent, \u201cyou\u201d is\npresent]), or [3, 0, 0, 2] if you prefer to count the number of occurrences of\neach word.\n\u2022 You may want to add hyperparameters to your preparation pipeline to control\nwhether or not to strip off email headers, convert each email to lowercase,\nremove punctuation, replace all URLs with \u201cURL,\u201d replace all numbers with\n\u201cNUMBER,\u201d or even perform stemming (i.e., trim off word endings; there are\nPython libraries available to do this).\n\u2022 Then try out several classifiers and see if you can build a great spam classifier,\nwith both high recall and high precision.\nSolutions to these exercises are available in the online Jupyter notebooks at https://\ngithub.com/ageron/handson-ml2.\nExercises\n|\nTraining Models\nWith Early Release ebooks, you get books in their earliest form\u2014\nthe author\u2019s raw and unedited content as he or she writes\u2014so you\ncan take advantage of these technologies long before the official\nrelease of these titles. The following will be Chapter 4 in the final\nrelease of the book.\nSo far we have treated Machine Learning models and their training algorithms mostly\nlike black boxes. If you went through some of the exercises in the previous chapters,\nyou may have been surprised by how much you can get done without knowing any\u2010\nthing about what\u2019s under the hood: you optimized a regression system, you improved\na digit image classifier, and you even built a spam classifier from scratch\u2014all this\nwithout knowing how they actually work. Indeed, in many situations you don\u2019t really\nneed to know the implementation details.\nHowever, having a good understanding of how things work can help you quickly\nhome in on the appropriate model, the right training algorithm to use, and a good set\nof hyperparameters for your task. Understanding what\u2019s under the hood will also help\nyou debug issues and perform error analysis more efficiently. Lastly, most of the top\u2010\nics discussed in this chapter will be essential in understanding, building, and training\nneural networks (discussed in Part II of this book).\nIn this chapter, we will start by looking at the Linear Regression model, one of the\nsimplest models there is. We will discuss two very different ways to train it:\n\u2022 Using a direct \u201cclosed-form\u201d equation that directly computes the model parame\u2010\nters that best fit the model to the training set (i.e., the model parameters that\nminimize the cost function over the training set).\n\u2022 Using an iterative optimization approach, called Gradient Descent (GD), that\ngradually tweaks the model parameters to minimize the cost function over the\ntraining set, eventually converging to the same set of parameters as the first\nmethod. We will look at a few variants of Gradient Descent that we will use again\nand again when we study neural networks in Part II: Batch GD, Mini-batch GD,\nand Stochastic GD.\nNext we will look at Polynomial Regression, a more complex model that can fit non\u2010\nlinear datasets. Since this model has more parameters than Linear Regression, it is\nmore prone to overfitting the training data, so we will look at how to detect whether\nor not this is the case, using learning curves, and then we will look at several regulari\u2010\nzation techniques that can reduce the risk of overfitting the training set.\nFinally, we will look at two more models that are commonly used for classification\ntasks: Logistic Regression and Softmax Regression.\nThere will be quite a few math equations in this chapter, using basic\nnotions of linear algebra and calculus. To understand these equa\u2010\ntions, you will need to know what vectors and matrices are, how to\ntranspose them, multiply them, and inverse them, and what partial\nderivatives are. If you are unfamiliar with these concepts, please go\nthrough the linear algebra and calculus introductory tutorials avail\u2010\nable as Jupyter notebooks in the online supplemental material. For\nthose who are truly allergic to mathematics, you should still go\nthrough this chapter and simply skip the equations; hopefully, the\ntext will be sufficient to help you understand most of the concepts.\nExercises\n1. What Linear Regression training algorithm can you use if you have a training set\nwith millions of features?\n2. Suppose the features in your training set have very different scales. What algo\u2010\nrithms might suffer from this, and how? What can you do about it?\n3. Can Gradient Descent get stuck in a local minimum when training a Logistic\nRegression model?\n4. Do all Gradient Descent algorithms lead to the same model provided you let\nthem run long enough?\n5. Suppose you use Batch Gradient Descent and you plot the validation error at\nevery epoch. If you notice that the validation error consistently goes up, what is\nlikely going on? How can you fix this?\n6. Is it a good idea to stop Mini-batch Gradient Descent immediately when the vali\u2010\ndation error goes up?\n7. Which Gradient Descent algorithm (among those we discussed) will reach the\nvicinity of the optimal solution the fastest? Which will actually converge? How\ncan you make the others converge as well?\n8. Suppose you are using Polynomial Regression. You plot the learning curves and\nyou notice that there is a large gap between the training error and the validation\nerror. What is happening? What are three ways to solve this?\n9. Suppose you are using Ridge Regression and you notice that the training error\nand the validation error are almost equal and fairly high. Would you say that the\nmodel suffers from high bias or high variance? Should you increase the regulari\u2010\nzation hyperparameter \u03b1 or reduce it?\n10. Why would you want to use:\n\u2022 Ridge Regression instead of plain Linear Regression (i.e., without any regulari\u2010\nzation)?\n\u2022 Lasso instead of Ridge Regression?\n\u2022 Elastic Net instead of Lasso?\n11. Suppose you want to classify pictures as outdoor/indoor and daytime/nighttime.\nShould you implement two Logistic Regression classifiers or one Softmax Regres\u2010\nsion classifier?\n12. Implement Batch Gradient Descent with early stopping for Softmax Regression\n(without using Scikit-Learn).\nSolutions to these exercises are available in ???.\nExercises\n|\nSupport Vector Machines\nWith Early Release ebooks, you get books in their earliest form\u2014\nthe author\u2019s raw and unedited content as he or she writes\u2014so you\ncan take advantage of these technologies long before the official\nrelease of these titles. The following will be Chapter 5 in the final\nrelease of the book.\nA Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a very powerful and versatile Machine Learning\nmodel, capable of performing linear or nonlinear classification, regression, and even\noutlier detection. It is one of the most popular models in Machine Learning, and any\u2010\none interested in Machine Learning should have it in their toolbox. SVMs are partic\u2010\nularly well suited for classification of complex but small- or medium-sized datasets.\nThis chapter will explain the core concepts of SVMs, how to use them, and how they\nwork.\nExercises\n1. What is the fundamental idea behind Support Vector Machines?\n2. What is a support vector?\n3. Why is it important to scale the inputs when using SVMs?\n4. Can an SVM classifier output a confidence score when it classifies an instance?\nWhat about a probability?\n5. Should you use the primal or the dual form of the SVM problem to train a model\non a training set with millions of instances and hundreds of features?\n6. Say you trained an SVM classifier with an RBF kernel. It seems to underfit the\ntraining set: should you increase or decrease \u03b3 (gamma)? What about C?\n7. How should you set the QP parameters (H, f, A, and b) to solve the soft margin\nlinear SVM classifier problem using an off-the-shelf QP solver?\n8. Train a LinearSVC on a linearly separable dataset. Then train an SVC and a\nSGDClassifier on the same dataset. See if you can get them to produce roughly\nthe same model.\n9. Train an SVM classifier on the MNIST dataset. Since SVM classifiers are binary\nclassifiers, you will need to use one-versus-all to classify all 10 digits. You may\nExercises\n|\nwant to tune the hyperparameters using small validation sets to speed up the pro\u2010\ncess. What accuracy can you reach?\n10. Train an SVM regressor on the California housing dataset.\nSolutions to these exercises are available in ???.\n|\nChapter 5: Support Vector Machines\nDecision Trees\nWith Early Release ebooks, you get books in their earliest form\u2014\nthe author\u2019s raw and unedited content as he or she writes\u2014so you\ncan take advantage of these technologies long before the official\nrelease of these titles. The following will be Chapter 6 in the final\nrelease of the book.\nLike SVMs, Decision Trees are versatile Machine Learning algorithms that can per\u2010\nform both classification and regression tasks, and even multioutput tasks. They are\nvery powerful algorithms, capable of fitting complex datasets. For example, in Chap\u2010\nter 2 you trained a DecisionTreeRegressor model on the California housing dataset,\nfitting it perfectly (actually overfitting it).\nDecision Trees are also the fundamental components of Random Forests (see Chap\u2010\nter 7), which are among the most powerful Machine Learning algorithms available\ntoday.\nIn this chapter we will start by discussing how to train, visualize, and make predic\u2010\ntions with Decision Trees. Then we will go through the CART training algorithm\nused by Scikit-Learn, and we will discuss how to regularize trees and use them for\nregression tasks. Finally, we will discuss some of the limitations of Decision Trees.\nExercises\n1. What is the approximate depth of a Decision Tree trained (without restrictions)\non a training set with 1 million instances?\n2. Is a node\u2019s Gini impurity generally lower or greater than its parent\u2019s? Is it gener\u2010\nally lower/greater, or always lower/greater?\n3. If a Decision Tree is overfitting the training set, is it a good idea to try decreasing\nmax_depth?\n4. If a Decision Tree is underfitting the training set, is it a good idea to try scaling\nthe input features?\n5. If it takes one hour to train a Decision Tree on a training set containing 1 million\ninstances, roughly how much time will it take to train another Decision Tree on a\ntraining set containing 10 million instances?\n6. If your training set contains 100,000 instances, will setting presort=True speed\nup training?\n7. Train and fine-tune a Decision Tree for the moons dataset.\na. Generate a moons dataset using make_moons(n_samples=10000, noise=0.4).\nb. Split it into a training set and a test set using train_test_split().\nExercises\n|\nc. Use grid search with cross-validation (with the help of the GridSearchCV\nclass) to find good hyperparameter values for a DecisionTreeClassifier.\nHint: try various values for max_leaf_nodes.\nd. Train it on the full training set using these hyperparameters, and measure\nyour model\u2019s performance on the test set. You should get roughly 85% to 87%\naccuracy.\n8. Grow a forest.\na. Continuing the previous exercise, generate 1,000 subsets of the training set,\neach containing 100 instances selected randomly. Hint: you can use Scikit-\nLearn\u2019s ShuffleSplit class for this.\nb. Train one Decision Tree on each subset, using the best hyperparameter values\nfound above. Evaluate these 1,000 Decision Trees on the test set. Since they\nwere trained on smaller sets, these Decision Trees will likely perform worse\nthan the first Decision Tree, achieving only about 80% accuracy.\nc. Now comes the magic. For each test set instance, generate the predictions of\nthe 1,000 Decision Trees, and keep only the most frequent prediction (you can\nuse SciPy\u2019s mode() function for this). This gives you majority-vote predictions\nover the test set.\nd. Evaluate these predictions on the test set: you should obtain a slightly higher\naccuracy than your first model (about 0.5 to 1.5% higher). Congratulations,\nyou have trained a Random Forest classifier!\nSolutions to these exercises are available in ???.\n|\nChapter 6: Decision Trees\nEnsemble Learning and Random Forests\nWith Early Release ebooks, you get books in their earliest form\u2014\nthe author\u2019s raw and unedited content as he or she writes\u2014so you\ncan take advantage of these technologies long before the official\nrelease of these titles. The following will be Chapter 7 in the final\nrelease of the book.\nSuppose you ask a complex question to thousands of random people, then aggregate\ntheir answers. In many cases you will find that this aggregated answer is better than\nan expert\u2019s answer. This is called the wisdom of the crowd. Similarly, if you aggregate\nthe predictions of a group of predictors (such as classifiers or regressors), you will\noften get better predictions than with the best individual predictor. A group of pre\u2010\ndictors is called an ensemble; thus, this technique is called Ensemble Learning, and an\nEnsemble Learning algorithm is called an Ensemble method.\nFor example, you can train a group of Decision Tree classifiers, each on a different\nrandom subset of the training set. To make predictions, you just obtain the predic\u2010\ntions of all individual trees, then predict the class that gets the most votes (see the last\nexercise in Chapter 6). Such an ensemble of Decision Trees is called a Random Forest,\nand despite its simplicity, this is one of the most powerful Machine Learning algo\u2010\nrithms available today.\nMoreover, as we discussed in Chapter 2, you will often use Ensemble methods near\nthe end of a project, once you have already built a few good predictors, to combine\nthem into an even better predictor. In fact, the winning solutions in Machine Learn\u2010\ning competitions often involve several Ensemble methods (most famously in the Net\u2010\nflix Prize competition).\nIn this chapter we will discuss the most popular Ensemble methods, including bag\u2010\nging, boosting, stacking, and a few others. We will also explore Random Forests.\nExercises\n1. If you have trained five different models on the exact same training data, and\nthey all achieve 95% precision, is there any chance that you can combine these\nmodels to get better results? If so, how? If not, why?\n2. What is the difference between hard and soft voting classifiers?\n3. Is it possible to speed up training of a bagging ensemble by distributing it across\nmultiple servers? What about pasting ensembles, boosting ensembles, random\nforests, or stacking ensembles?\n4. What is the benefit of out-of-bag evaluation?\n5. What makes Extra-Trees more random than regular Random Forests? How can\nthis extra randomness help? Are Extra-Trees slower or faster than regular Ran\u2010\ndom Forests?\n6. If your AdaBoost ensemble underfits the training data, what hyperparameters\nshould you tweak and how?\nExercises\n|\n7. If your Gradient Boosting ensemble overfits the training set, should you increase\nor decrease the learning rate?\n8. Load the MNIST data (introduced in Chapter 3), and split it into a training set, a\nvalidation set, and a test set (e.g., use 50,000 instances for training, 10,000 for val\u2010\nidation, and 10,000 for testing). Then train various classifiers, such as a Random\nForest classifier, an Extra-Trees classifier, and an SVM. Next, try to combine\nthem into an ensemble that outperforms them all on the validation set, using a\nsoft or hard voting classifier. Once you have found one, try it on the test set. How\nmuch better does it perform compared to the individual classifiers?\n9. Run the individual classifiers from the previous exercise to make predictions on\nthe validation set, and create a new training set with the resulting predictions:\neach training instance is a vector containing the set of predictions from all your\nclassifiers for an image, and the target is the image\u2019s class. Train a classifier on\nthis new training set. Congratulations, you have just trained a blender, and\ntogether with the classifiers they form a stacking ensemble! Now let\u2019s evaluate the\nensemble on the test set. For each image in the test set, make predictions with all\nyour classifiers, then feed the predictions to the blender to get the ensemble\u2019s pre\u2010\ndictions. How does it compare to the voting classifier you trained earlier?\nSolutions to these exercises are available in ???.\n|\nChapter 7: Ensemble Learning and Random Forests\nDimensionality Reduction\nWith Early Release ebooks, you get books in their earliest form\u2014\nthe author\u2019s raw and unedited content as he or she writes\u2014so you\ncan take advantage of these technologies long before the official\nrelease of these titles. The following will be Chapter 8 in the final\nrelease of the book.\nMany Machine Learning problems involve thousands or even millions of features for\neach training instance. Not only does this make training extremely slow, it can also\nmake it much harder to find a good solution, as we will see. This problem is often\nreferred to as the curse of dimensionality.\nFortunately, in real-world problems, it is often possible to reduce the number of fea\u2010\ntures considerably, turning an intractable problem into a tractable one. For example,\nconsider the MNIST images (introduced in Chapter 3): the pixels on the image bor\u2010\nders are almost always white, so you could completely drop these pixels from the\ntraining set without losing much information. Figure 7-6 confirms that these pixels\nare utterly unimportant for the classification task. Moreover, two neighboring pixels\nare often highly correlated: if you merge them into a single pixel (e.g., by taking the\nmean of the two pixel intensities), you will not lose much information.\n1 Well, four dimensions if you count time, and a few more if you are a string theorist.\nReducing dimensionality does lose some information (just like\ncompressing an image to JPEG can degrade its quality), so even\nthough it will speed up training, it may also make your system per\u2010\nform slightly worse. It also makes your pipelines a bit more com\u2010\nplex and thus harder to maintain. So you should first try to train\nyour system with the original data before considering using dimen\u2010\nsionality reduction if training is too slow. In some cases, however,\nreducing the dimensionality of the training data may filter out\nsome noise and unnecessary details and thus result in higher per\u2010\nformance (but in general it won\u2019t; it will just speed up training).\nApart from speeding up training, dimensionality reduction is also extremely useful\nfor data visualization (or DataViz). Reducing the number of dimensions down to two\n(or three) makes it possible to plot a condensed view of a high-dimensional training\nset on a graph and often gain some important insights by visually detecting patterns,\nsuch as clusters. Moreover, DataViz is essential to communicate your conclusions to\npeople who are not data scientists, in particular decision makers who will use your\nresults.\nIn this chapter we will discuss the curse of dimensionality and get a sense of what\ngoes on in high-dimensional space. Then, we will present the two main approaches to\ndimensionality reduction (projection and Manifold Learning), and we will go\nthrough three of the most popular dimensionality reduction techniques: PCA, Kernel\nPCA, and LLE.\nExercises\n1. What are the main motivations for reducing a dataset\u2019s dimensionality? What are\nthe main drawbacks?\n2. What is the curse of dimensionality?\n3. Once a dataset\u2019s dimensionality has been reduced, is it possible to reverse the\noperation? If so, how? If not, why?\n4. Can PCA be used to reduce the dimensionality of a highly nonlinear dataset?\n5. Suppose you perform PCA on a 1,000-dimensional dataset, setting the explained\nvariance ratio to 95%. How many dimensions will the resulting dataset have?\nExercises\n|\n6. In what cases would you use vanilla PCA, Incremental PCA, Randomized PCA,\nor Kernel PCA?\n7. How can you evaluate the performance of a dimensionality reduction algorithm\non your dataset?\n8. Does it make any sense to chain two different dimensionality reduction algo\u2010\nrithms?\n9. Load the MNIST dataset (introduced in Chapter 3) and split it into a training set\nand a test set (take the first 60,000 instances for training, and the remaining\n10,000 for testing). Train a Random Forest classifier on the dataset and time how\nlong it takes, then evaluate the resulting model on the test set. Next, use PCA to\nreduce the dataset\u2019s dimensionality, with an explained variance ratio of 95%.\nTrain a new Random Forest classifier on the reduced dataset and see how long it\ntakes. Was training much faster? Next evaluate the classifier on the test set: how\ndoes it compare to the previous classifier?\n10. Use t-SNE to reduce the MNIST dataset down to two dimensions and plot the\nresult using Matplotlib. You can use a scatterplot using 10 different colors to rep\u2010\nresent each image\u2019s target class. Alternatively, you can write colored digits at the\nlocation of each instance, or even plot scaled-down versions of the digit images\nthemselves (if you plot all digits, the visualization will be too cluttered, so you\nshould either draw a random sample or plot an instance only if no other instance\nhas already been plotted at a close distance). You should get a nice visualization\nwith well-separated clusters of digits. Try using other dimensionality reduction\nalgorithms such as PCA, LLE, or MDS and compare the resulting visualizations.\nSolutions to these exercises are available in ???.\n|\nChapter 8: Dimensionality Reduction\nUnsupervised Learning Techniques\nWith Early Release ebooks, you get books in their earliest form\u2014\nthe author\u2019s raw and unedited content as he or she writes\u2014so you\ncan take advantage of these technologies long before the official\nrelease of these titles. The following will be Chapter 9 in the final\nrelease of the book.\nAlthough most of the applications of Machine Learning today are based on super\u2010\nvised learning (and as a result, this is where most of the investments go to), the vast\nmajority of the available data is actually unlabeled: we have the input features X, but\nwe do not have the labels y. Yann LeCun famously said that \u201cif intelligence was a cake,\nunsupervised learning would be the cake, supervised learning would be the icing on\nthe cake, and reinforcement learning would be the cherry on the cake\u201d\n. In other\nwords, there is a huge potential in unsupervised learning that we have only barely\nstarted to sink our teeth into.\nFor example, say you want to create a system that will take a few pictures of each item\non a manufacturing production line and detect which items are defective. You can\nfairly easily create a system that will take pictures automatically, and this might give\nyou thousands of pictures every day. You can then build a reasonably large dataset in\njust a few weeks. But wait, there are no labels! If you want to train a regular binary\nclassifier that will predict whether an item is defective or not, you will need to label\nevery single picture as \u201cdefective\u201d or \u201cnormal\u201d\n. This will generally require human\nexperts to sit down and manually go through all the pictures. This is a long, costly\nand tedious task, so it will usually only be done on a small subset of the available pic\u2010\ntures. As a result, the labeled dataset will be quite small, and the classifier\u2019s perfor\u2010\nmance will be disappointing. Moreover, every time the company makes any change to\nits products, the whole process will need to be started over from scratch. Wouldn\u2019t it\nbe great if the algorithm could just exploit the unlabeled data without needing\nhumans to label every picture? Enter unsupervised learning.\nIn Chapter 8, we looked at the most common unsupervised learning task: dimension\u2010\nality reduction. In this chapter, we will look at a few more unsupervised learning tasks\nand algorithms:\n\u2022 Clustering: the goal is to group similar instances together into clusters. This is a\ngreat tool for data analysis, customer segmentation, recommender systems,\nsearch engines, image segmentation, semi-supervised learning, dimensionality\nreduction, and more.\n\u2022 Anomaly detection: the objective is to learn what \u201cnormal\u201d data looks like, and\nuse this to detect abnormal instances, such as defective items on a production\nline or a new trend in a time series.\n\u2022 Density estimation: this is the task of estimating the probability density function\n(PDF) of the random process that generated the dataset. This is commonly used\nfor anomaly detection: instances located in very low-density regions are likely to\nbe anomalies. It is also useful for data analysis and visualization.\nReady for some cake? We will start with clustering, using K-Means and DBSCAN,\nand then we will discuss Gaussian mixture models and see how they can be used for\ndensity estimation, clustering, and anomaly detection.\nExercises\n1. Visit the TensorFlow Playground at https://playground.tensorflow.org/\n\u2022 Layers and patterns: try training the default neural network by clicking the run\nbutton (top left). Notice how it quickly finds a good solution for the classifica\u2010\ntion task. Notice that the neurons in the first hidden layer have learned simple\npatterns, while the neurons in the second hidden layer have learned to com\u2010\nbine the simple patterns of the first hidden layer into more complex patterns.\nIn general, the more layers, the more complex the patterns can be.\n\u2022 Activation function: try replacing the Tanh activation function with the ReLU\nactivation function, and train the network again. Notice that it finds a solution\neven faster, but this time the boundaries are linear. This is due to the shape of\nthe ReLU function.\n\u2022 Local minima: modify the network architecture to have just one hidden layer\nwith three neurons. Train it multiple times (to reset the network weights, click\nthe reset button next to the play button). Notice that the training time varies a\nlot, and sometimes it even gets stuck in a local minimum.\n\u2022 Too small: now remove one neuron to keep just 2. Notice that the neural net\u2010\nwork is now incapable of finding a good solution, even if you try multiple\ntimes. The model has too few parameters and it systematically underfits the\ntraining set.\n\u2022 Large enough: next, set the number of neurons to 8 and train the network sev\u2010\neral times. Notice that it is now consistently fast and never gets stuck. This\nhighlights an important finding in neural network theory: large neural net\u2010\nworks almost never get stuck in local minima, and even when they do these\nlocal optima are almost as good as the global optimum. However, they can still\nget stuck on long plateaus for a long time.\n\u2022 Deep net and vanishing gradients: now change the dataset to be the spiral (bot\u2010\ntom right dataset under \u201cDATA\u201d). Change the network architecture to have 4\nhidden layers with 8 neurons each. Notice that training takes much longer, and\noften gets stuck on plateaus for long periods of time. Also notice that the neu\u2010\nrons in the highest layers (i.e. on the right) tend to evolve faster than the neu\u2010\nrons in the lowest layers (i.e. on the left). This problem, called the \u201cvanishing\ngradients\u201d problem, can be alleviated using better weight initialization and\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\nother techniques, better optimizers (such as AdaGrad or Adam), or using\nBatch Normalization.\n\u2022 More: go ahead and play with the other parameters to get a feel of what they\ndo. In fact, you should definitely play with this UI for at least one hour, it will\ngrow your intuitions about neural networks significantly.\n2. Draw an ANN using the original artificial neurons (like the ones in Figure 10-3)\nthat computes A \u2295 B (where \u2295 represents the XOR operation). Hint: A \u2295 B = (A\n\u2227 \u00ac B) \u2228 (\u00ac A \u2227 B).\n3. Why is it generally preferable to use a Logistic Regression classifier rather than a\nclassical Perceptron (i.e., a single layer of threshold logic units trained using the\nPerceptron training algorithm)? How can you tweak a Perceptron to make it\nequivalent to a Logistic Regression classifier?\n4. Why was the logistic activation function a key ingredient in training the first\nMLPs?\n5. Name three popular activation functions. Can you draw them?\n6. Suppose you have an MLP composed of one input layer with 10 passthrough\nneurons, followed by one hidden layer with 50 artificial neurons, and finally one\noutput layer with 3 artificial neurons. All artificial neurons use the ReLU activa\u2010\ntion function.\n\u2022 What is the shape of the input matrix X?\n\u2022 What about the shape of the hidden layer\u2019s weight vector Wh, and the shape of\nits bias vector bh?\n\u2022 What is the shape of the output layer\u2019s weight vector Wo, and its bias vector bo?\n\u2022 What is the shape of the network\u2019s output matrix Y?\n\u2022 Write the equation that computes the network\u2019s output matrix Y as a function\nof X, Wh, bh, Wo and bo.\n7. How many neurons do you need in the output layer if you want to classify email\ninto spam or ham? What activation function should you use in the output layer?\nIf instead you want to tackle MNIST, how many neurons do you need in the out\u2010\nput layer, using what activation function? Answer the same questions for getting\nyour network to predict housing prices as in Chapter 2.\n8. What is backpropagation and how does it work? What is the difference between\nbackpropagation and reverse-mode autodiff?\n9. Can you list all the hyperparameters you can tweak in an MLP? If the MLP over\u2010\nfits the training data, how could you tweak these hyperparameters to try to solve\nthe problem?\nExercises\n|\n10. Train a deep MLP on the MNIST dataset and see if you can get over 98% preci\u2010\nsion. Try adding all the bells and whistles (i.e., save checkpoints, use early stop\u2010\nping, plot learning curves using TensorBoard, and so on).\nSolutions to these exercises are available in ???.\n|\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\nTraining Deep Neural Networks\nWith Early Release ebooks, you get books in their earliest form\u2014\nthe author\u2019s raw and unedited content as he or she writes\u2014so you\ncan take advantage of these technologies long before the official\nrelease of these titles. The following will be Chapter 11 in the final\nrelease of the book.\nIn Chapter 10 we introduced artificial neural networks and trained our first deep\nneural networks. But they were very shallow nets, with just a few hidden layers. What\nif you need to tackle a very complex problem, such as detecting hundreds of types of\nobjects in high-resolution images? You may need to train a much deeper DNN, per\u2010\nhaps with 10 layers or much more, each containing hundreds of neurons, connected\nby hundreds of thousands of connections. This would not be a walk in the park:\n\u2022 First, you would be faced with the tricky vanishing gradients problem (or the\nrelated exploding gradients problem) that affects deep neural networks and makes\nlower layers very hard to train.\n\u2022 Second, you might not have enough training data for such a large network, or it\nmight be too costly to label.\n\u2022 Third, training may be extremely slow.\n\u2022 Fourth, a model with millions of parameters would severely risk overfitting the\ntraining set, especially if there are not enough training instances, or they are too\nnoisy.\nIn this chapter, we will go through each of these problems in turn and present techni\u2010\nques to solve them. We will start by explaining the vanishing gradients problem and\nexploring some of the most popular solutions to this problem. Next, we will look at\ntransfer learning and unsupervised pretraining, which can help you tackle complex\n1 \u201cUnderstanding the Difficulty of Training Deep Feedforward Neural Networks,\u201d X. Glorot, Y Bengio (2010).\ntasks even when you have little labeled data. Then we will discuss various optimizers\nthat can speed up training large models tremendously compared to plain Gradient\nDescent. Finally, we will go through a few popular regularization techniques for large\nneural networks.\nWith these tools, you will be able to train very deep nets: welcome to Deep Learning!\nExercises\n1. Is it okay to initialize all the weights to the same value as long as that value is\nselected randomly using He initialization?\n2. Is it okay to initialize the bias terms to 0?\n3. Name three advantages of the SELU activation function over ReLU.\n|\nChapter 11: Training Deep Neural Networks\n4. In which cases would you want to use each of the following activation functions:\nSELU, leaky ReLU (and its variants), ReLU, tanh, logistic, and softmax?\n5. What may happen if you set the momentum hyperparameter too close to 1 (e.g.,\n0.99999) when using an SGD optimizer?\n6. Name three ways you can produce a sparse model.\n7. Does dropout slow down training? Does it slow down inference (i.e., making\npredictions on new instances)? What are about MC dropout?\n8. Deep Learning.\na. Build a DNN with five hidden layers of 100 neurons each, He initialization,\nand the ELU activation function.\nb. Using Adam optimization and early stopping, try training it on MNIST but\nonly on digits 0 to 4, as we will use transfer learning for digits 5 to 9 in the\nnext exercise. You will need a softmax output layer with five neurons, and as\nalways make sure to save checkpoints at regular intervals and save the final\nmodel so you can reuse it later.\nc. Tune the hyperparameters using cross-validation and see what precision you\ncan achieve.\nd. Now try adding Batch Normalization and compare the learning curves: is it\nconverging faster than before? Does it produce a better model?\ne. Is the model overfitting the training set? Try adding dropout to every layer\nand try again. Does it help?\n9. Transfer learning.\na. Create a new DNN that reuses all the pretrained hidden layers of the previous\nmodel, freezes them, and replaces the softmax output layer with a new one.\nb. Train this new DNN on digits 5 to 9, using only 100 images per digit, and time\nhow long it takes. Despite this small number of examples, can you achieve\nhigh precision?\nc. Try caching the frozen layers, and train the model again: how much faster is it\nnow?\nd. Try again reusing just four hidden layers instead of five. Can you achieve a\nhigher precision?\ne. Now unfreeze the top two hidden layers and continue training: can you get\nthe model to perform even better?\n10. Pretraining on an auxiliary task.\na. In this exercise you will build a DNN that compares two MNIST digit images\nand predicts whether they represent the same digit or not. Then you will reuse\nthe lower layers of this network to train an MNIST classifier using very little\nExercises\n|\ntraining data. Start by building two DNNs (let\u2019s call them DNN A and B), both\nsimilar to the one you built earlier but without the output layer: each DNN\nshould have five hidden layers of 100 neurons each, He initialization, and ELU\nactivation. Next, add one more hidden layer with 10 units on top of both\nDNNs. To do this, you should use a keras.layers.Concatenate layer to con\u2010\ncatenate the outputs of both DNNs for each instance, then feed the result to\nthe hidden layer. Finally, add an output layer with a single neuron using the\nlogistic activation function.\nb. Split the MNIST training set in two sets: split #1 should containing 55,000\nimages, and split #2 should contain contain 5,000 images. Create a function\nthat generates a training batch where each instance is a pair of MNIST images\npicked from split #1. Half of the training instances should be pairs of images\nthat belong to the same class, while the other half should be images from dif\u2010\nferent classes. For each pair, the training label should be 0 if the images are\nfrom the same class, or 1 if they are from different classes.\nc. Train the DNN on this training set. For each image pair, you can simultane\u2010\nously feed the first image to DNN A and the second image to DNN B. The\nwhole network will gradually learn to tell whether two images belong to the\nsame class or not.\nd. Now create a new DNN by reusing and freezing the hidden layers of DNN A\nand adding a softmax output layer on top with 10 neurons. Train this network\non split #2 and see if you can achieve high performance despite having only\n500 images per class.\nSolutions to these exercises are available in ???.\n|\nChapter 11: Training Deep Neural Networks\nCustom Models and Training with\nTensorFlow\nWith Early Release ebooks, you get books in their earliest form\u2014\nthe author\u2019s raw and unedited content as he or she writes\u2014so you\ncan take advantage of these technologies long before the official\nrelease of these titles. The following will be Chapter 12 in the final\nrelease of the book.\nSo far we have used only TensorFlow\u2019s high level API, tf.keras, but it already got us\npretty far: we built various neural network architectures, including regression and\nclassification nets, wide & deep nets and self-normalizing nets, using all sorts of tech\u2010\nniques, such as Batch Normalization, dropout, learning rate schedules, and more. In\nfact, 95% of the use cases you will encounter will not require anything else than\ntf.keras (and tf.data, see Chapter 13). But now it\u2019s time to dive deeper into TensorFlow\nand take a look at its lower-level Python API. This will be useful when you need extra\ncontrol, to write custom loss functions, custom metrics, layers, models, initializers,\nregularizers, weight constraints and more. You may even need to fully control the\ntraining loop itself, for example to apply special transformations or constraints to the\ngradients (beyond just clipping them), or to use multiple optimizers for different\nparts of the network. We will cover all these cases in this chapter, then we will also\nlook at how you can boost your custom models and training algorithms using Ten\u2010\nsorFlow\u2019s automatic graph generation feature. But first, let\u2019s take a quick tour of Ten\u2010\nsorFlow.\n1 TensorFlow also includes another Deep Learning API called the Estimators API, but it is now recommended\nto use tf.keras instead.\nTensorFlow 2.0 was released in March 2019, making TensorFlow\nmuch easier to use. The first edition of this book used TF 1, while\nthis edition uses TF 2.\nExercises\n1. What are the advantages of a CNN over a fully connected DNN for image classi\u2010\nfication?\n2. Consider a CNN composed of three convolutional layers, each with 3 \u00d7 3 kernels,\na stride of 2, and SAME padding. The lowest layer outputs 100 feature maps, the\nmiddle one outputs 200, and the top one outputs 400. The input images are RGB\nimages of 200 \u00d7 300 pixels. What is the total number of parameters in the CNN?\nIf we are using 32-bit floats, at least how much RAM will this network require\nwhen making a prediction for a single instance?

Use transfer learning for large image classification.\na. Create a training set containing at least 100 images per class. For example, you\ncould classify your own pictures based on the location (beach, mountain, city,\netc.), or alternatively you can just use an existing dataset (e.g., from Tensor\u2010\nFlow Datasets).\nb. Split it into a training set, a validation set and a test set.\nc. Build the input pipeline, including the appropriate preprocessing operations,\nand optionally add data augmentation.\nd. Fine-tune a pretrained model on this dataset.\n11. Go through TensorFlow\u2019s DeepDream tutorial.

A former Googler, he led the You\u2010\nTube video classification team from 2013 to 2016. He was also a founder and CTO of\nWifirst from 2002 to 2012, a leading Wireless ISP in France; and a founder and CTO\nof Polyconseil in 2001, the firm that now manages the electric car sharing service\nAutolib\u2019\n.\nBefore this he worked as an engineer in a variety of domains: finance (JP Morgan and\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale), defense (Canada\u2019s DOD), and healthcare (blood transfusion). He\npublished a few technical books (on C++, WiFi, and internet architectures), and was\na Computer Science lecturer in a French engineering school.\nA few fun facts: he taught his three children to count in binary with their fingers (up\nto 1023), he studied microbiology and evolutionary genetics before going into soft\u2010\nware engineering, and his parachute didn\u2019t open on the second jump.\nColophon\nThe animal on the cover of Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Ten\u2010\nsorFlow is the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra), an amphibian found across\nmost of Europe. Its black, glossy skin features large yellow spots on the head and\nback, signaling the presence of alkaloid toxins. This is a possible source of this\namphibian\u2019s common name: contact with these toxins (which they can also spray\nshort distances) causes convulsions and hyperventilation. Either the painful poisons\nor the moistness of the salamander\u2019s skin (or both) led to a misguided belief that these\ncreatures not only could survive being placed in fire but could extinguish it as well.\nFire salamanders live in shaded forests, hiding in moist crevices and under logs near\nthe pools or other freshwater bodies that facilitate their breeding. Though they spend\nmost of their life on land, they give birth to their young in water. They subsist mostly\non a diet of insects, spiders, slugs, and worms. Fire salamanders can grow up to a foot\nin length, and in captivity, may live as long as 50 years.\nThe fire salamander\u2019s numbers have been reduced by destruction of their forest habi\u2010\ntat and capture for the pet trade, but the greatest threat is the susceptibility of their\nmoisture-permeable skin to pollutants and microbes. Since 2014, they have become\nextinct in parts of the Netherlands and Belgium due to an introduced fungus.\nMany of the animals on O\u2019Reilly covers are endangered; all of them are important to\nthe world.
